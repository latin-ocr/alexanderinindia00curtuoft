10 ἓξ 1-7] NOTES. 103

fitcturi] Curtius is much given to the use of the future participle
when he wants to express willingness or purpose. Compare §3’ 2, 33.

Jove ,gn-nilum] this expression, like many others in Curtius, has a
poetic ring. Compare lx S ἓ 22 l'lzz'lt'ppogcnitmm virgil Aen IX 642
dts genite ct geniture deas. For the construction see Madvig ἓ 269.

ipsos]=sc. Curtius writes thus osten. Compare§ 9, 11 g 21, 12 ξ 17,
¹3 §s 20, 24, 12< ¹§§⁸,20‚3§11‚4§25‚5§§1‚ 25, 9§§3‚6, 21,
10 ἐς· 14, 19. See Seneca in appendix A ξ 6.

sama captim] see the beginning of Arrian's Indica generally, in
particular 5 ἓ 8 καὶ πρὸ Ἀλεξάνδρου Διονύσου μὲν πέρι πολλὸς Myos
κατέχει, ὠς καὶ τούτου στρατευσαντοςές Ἴνδοῦς καὶ καταστρεψαμένουἸνδοὺς·
Ἡρακλέος δὲ πέρι οὐ πολλός. See Thirlwall c 53 (vol VH p 12).

§ 2. cclcrum]:sed. This is too common in Curtius to need illus-
tration.

amplius nemo] no one morer-‘no others ’. He means none of the
important rages, as opposed to figuli the chiefs of small tribes.

parte] a considerable part. Compare LivyI ιο Caeninenses Crus-
tuminique ct Antemnates crant acl quos eins iniuriae pars pertinebat.
Or perhaps pars may here as sometimes (see Lucretius 1 617, ΙΙ 200)
mean ‘half', since Arrian's words lv 22 ἕ 7 are διελὼν τήν στρατιάν.

acl subigendas qul] qui=eos qui. See on ξ ῐο.

§3. iunxere] ‘put together ’. Miitzell compares VII 8 ἓ 8 tanta Ι
alam-state militum rates iunctae sunt, ut intra triduum ad XII milia
cjffi'ctae sint.

solutae vela] :solvi et velli. The more important notion is expressed
by the participle. The construction is adopted from the Greek.

§4 phalange] for this famous formation of the best Macedonian
infant5y and its subdivisions armament etc see Thirlwall c 48 (vol VI
P 147 ·

ἓ 5. praecipit] Arrian 1v 23 ἓ 5 does not attribute the massacre to
the orders of Alexander, but to the anger of the soldiers at the wounding
of their king.

ne] compare VII 1 ἓ 38 praecepisti {gitur milzz' ne quem praeter te
intuerer. See Madvig ξ 456.

parceretur] verbs which govern a dative in the active are generally
used impersonally in the passive. See Kennedy ἓ 135 g.

ἓ 6. obequitat] for the dative following verbs compounded with
prepositions which themselves govern an accusative see Madvig ξ 224.

ἓ 7. Affsam] the position of this place is very uncertain. The best
authority on the subject is General Cunningham. For the name of the
place and mount Meru or Μηρὸς, both probably corruptions of Hindu
names to flatter Alexander's vanity‚ see Strabo xv 1 ἐξ 7, 8, Arrian v t
ξ 6, Indica 5 ἓ 9, Diodorus 11 38, Pomponius Mela 111 7, Pliny N H VI
ἕ 79, and the remarks of 'I'hirlwall c 53 (vol V11 pp 1 1—13).

frigus] it is to be remembered that this was in February or March
326 B C and we know from the reports of our countryrnen in those parts
