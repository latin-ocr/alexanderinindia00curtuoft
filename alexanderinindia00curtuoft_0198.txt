Polypercon] or Poly-eperchon, one of the oldest veterans in the
service of Alexander commanded a division of the phalanx. We find
him mentioned as present at the passage of the Hydaspes and also in
the descent of the Indus when he was under the command of Craterus
with whom he was subsequently sent to conduct the discharged veterans
back to Greece. Being absent at Alexander's death he was passed
over and is not heard of again till sometime after that event.

Ptolemy] the reputed son of Lagus and thus of obscure origin, but
also said to be an illegitimate son of Philip, was probably the ablest of
Alexander’s officers and was the author of an account of his conquests.
lle was banished from Macedonia on the discovery of Alexander s pro·
jected marriage with the daughter of Pixodarus, and this event was the
beginning of his subsequent elevation. In conjunction with Asander he
defeated Orontobates and captured Halicarnassus and other strong
places in Caria. At the forcing of the Persian Gates he was in com-
mand of a division of 3000 men and was made a somatophylax in the
room of Demetrius. He was sent to arrest Bessus and commanded a
column in the operations across the Oxus and was engaged at the siege
of the fortress of Chorienes. It was he who gained information of the
plot of Hermolaus and the pages and reported it to Alexander, thereby
in all probability saving the king's life. In the campaign against the
Aspasians he killed their chief with his own hand. In the operations
against the Malli he commanded one of the three corps of invasion ant',
in the district of Oritis (or in the kingdom of Sambus) he received a
wound which was healed by the application of a herb discovered by
Alexander himself, who was thus enabled to requite his friend for saving
his own life as above mentioned. On the return from India he was
married to a daughter of Artabanus. After Alexander’s death Egypt
fell to his share and there he maintained himself and founded a
dynasty.

stsoeostus] or Sisicottus, an Indian leader of mercenaries who,
when Bessus fell into Alexander's hands, submitted and became attached
to the conqueror. It was he who gave Alexander accounts of the
country beyond the Indus. To him was committed the charge of the
important rock-fortress of Aornis or Aornus.
