§ 15. lascivia] Arrian v 2 ἓ 6 καὶ τοὺς Μακεδόνας ἡδέως τὸν κισσὸν
ἰδόντας, οἶα δὴ δια μακροῦ ὀφθέντα (οὐ ’γὰρ εἶναι ἐν τῇ Ἰνδῶν χώρᾳ κισσὸν
εὗδ’ ἵναπερ αὐτοῖς ἄμπελοι ἦσαν) στεφάνους σπουδῇ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ποιήσασθαι
καὶ στεφανώσασθαι ὡς εἶχον ἐφυμνοῦντας τὸν Διόνυσόν τε καὶ τας ἐπωνυμίας
τοῦ θεοῦ ἀνακαλοῦντας.

redimiti fronde] has a poetical ring.

pare Yirgil Aen V 102 sztsz'pcr herbam.

omnibus] all sorts of provision. For the sense compare Virgil Aen
v 61, 62.

operatum] in present signification :busiecL See Madvig ἓ 146.
The word is commonly used of sacrificial observances.

habuit] ‘l ep t'. Ι or the sense of this passage generally Miitzell

second of which he maintained that his hero grew gteat not through
somme but 1n fortune’s spite.

inter ota] M'utzell well compares virgil Aen ΙΙ 681 manus inter
maestorumque ora parentum.

ἓ 19. Daedala] only once mentioned by one other writer, Justin XII
7, where we find Daedali montes. Miiller in Smith's Atlas ot¹ Ancient
Geography thinks that the place ’Ἄνδακα οΥἋνδηλα in Arrian IV 23 ἓ 5
is the same, and that we should there emend Δαίδαλα.

Acadira] this name is found only in Curtius. Miiller prefers to
read Caudim, and thinks that the name is connected with that of the
Khond mountain. Schneider (quoted by Zumpt) takes the name to
stand sor the same place as the Ἀριγαῖον mentioned by Arrian lv 24

usta] Acidalius conjectured vasta as no burning had been spoken
of in the former case. But Zumpt now observes that Arrian in the
place just referred to says καὶ ταύτην καταλαμβάνει ἐμπεπρησμένην ὑπὸ
των ἐνοικούντων καὶ τούς ἀνθρώπους πεφευγότας.

§zo- rationem] principle, plan.

oppressi] that is incolae. But the text is probably corrupt here. For
the xxv-md opp-‘'esst: ‘surprised' compare VI 8 ἓ ‘21 illum szz e secmz'tate
