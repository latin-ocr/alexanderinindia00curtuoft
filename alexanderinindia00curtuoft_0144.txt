140 ρ. CURTJ RUFI HJSJ: ALEX. [1x25 34

Alexander broke up the mecting and on the morrow assembled them
again and αὐτὸς μὲν ἰέναι ἔφη τοῦ πρόσω, βιάσεσθαι δὲ οὐδένα ἄκοντα
Μακεδόνων ξυνέπεσθαι· ἕξειν ’γάρ τοὺς ἀκολουθήσοντας τῷ βασιλεῖ σφῶν
ἔκοντας· τοῖς δὲ καὶ ἀπιέναι οἴκαδε ἐθέλουσιν ὑπάρχειν ἀπιέναι καὶ ἐξαγ-
γέλλειν τοῖς οἰκείοις ὅτι τὸν βασιλέα σφῶν ἐν μέσοις τοῖς πολεμίοις ἐπανή-
κουσιν ἀπολιπόντες.

α vohis etc] ‘ sor the victory that you have given uo hope οἷ’. locum
inveniam goes somewhat awkwardly with this, bnt is natural enough
with morti.

CIIAPTER ΙΙΙ.

§L expectabant ut etc] this construction is rare, but found in
Caesar bell civ 1 66 neque expectant ut de eorum imperio ad populum
seratur. Render ‘ wait for ’-

perfert-crit etc] ‘ report [the news] that ’.... The construction is like
that with nuntio (see V111 14 ἓ 1) and other words.

illz] that is, the duces princzpae‘sque.
ἓ 2. sua spontel ‘of its own accord ’‚ that is, no one knew hOW.

liberius] compare VI ι’, §4 secessio militum et liberior inter mutuas
querellas dolor.

mgr] to raise itself, arise.
temperare oculis] to refrain from tears. Compare Livy XXI 22.

§ 3. propius tribunal] compare V11 7 ἓ 9 propius {fisum considere
amicos iubet, and see Madvig ἓ 172 part 111 obs 4.

ξ 5. tum Coenus] this speech put into the mouth of Coenus has a
peculiarliterary interest beyond the ordinary mn of orations written for
their leading characters by the rhetorical historians of antiquity. In the
remaining works os the elder Seneca we have a suasoria or hortatory
oration (see Mayor on Juvenal 1 16) on this very subject, in which are
arranged all the telling sentences that some os the most famous Roman
rhetoricians could compose to suit the situation. The remarkable
parallels found in this collection to the present speech of Curtius illus-
trate in a very striking way the artificial nature os these harangues, and
shew what a vast amount of labour this spirited and polished specimen
probably took to produce. The corresponding speech in Arrian v 27,
though less pointed than that in Curtius, is more natural and easy, and
certainly sar superior to that put into the mouth of Alexander. See
appendix A.

inpias mentes] ‘disloyal thoughts ’. So virgil georg 1 511 Mars
inpius, Aen VI 612 arma impia, speaking os civil wars-
proficto] one may be sure, ‘ assuredly ‘. For the general form of the

sentence compare v 8 ξ 9 όιζςνηιζτςῐηιί quibus, si ego non possim, a'z'i pro me
gratiam referant. et mehercule reserent.

idem animus etc] Arrian V ¹27 ἓ 4 on the contrary ὀλίγοι δὲ ἐκ πολ·
λῶν ὑπολείπονται, καὶ οὔτε τοῖς σώμασιν ἔτι ὡσαύτως ἐρρωμένοι, ταῖς τε
γνώμαις πολὺ ε’τι μᾶλλον προκεκμηκότες.
