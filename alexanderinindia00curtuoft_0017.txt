INTRODUCTJOM 13

have this further trait in common with the mass of Roman
writers, that they utterly miss the high ainis and far-sightedness
which give its true grandem· to the character of Alexander.
To them—whether from national jealousy or imperfect in-
formation—the Macedonian youth is merely the brilliant con-
queror of insatiate ambiam, Fortune’s very darling. To us
the partial view of Plutarch seems nearer the tuith, that he
was ever at odds with Fortune and became great in spite
of her.

(4) The Latin of Curtius is probably a good average speci-
men of the Latin of the early Empire, the so-called silver-age.
Inferior in vigour to the balanced sermon style of Seneca or the
painful and muscular energy of the Tacitean Annals‚ it reminds
us in descriptive passages of the elder Pliny, and generally (both
in the speeches and elsewhere) of the earlier writings of Tacitus.
His imitation of Livy is sufficiently transparent‚ and in common
with most writers of his day he betrays frequently an attentive
study of Virgil. To enter into minute details concerning the
peculiarities of his diction and syntax is beyond the scope of the
present edition. It may be remarked in general that his vocabu-
lary is a liniited and commonplace one, containing few strange

. words but many familiar words in strange senses. His habit of
using the very same construction and even the same phrase
over and over again has a tiresome effcct3 but this is a common
fault in the later Greek and Latin writers. Still with all its de-
fects the style of Curtius has the merit of being terse and
generally clear3 if he now and then strains too hard after anti-
thesis, at least he succeeds in bringing his point home to the
reader. A few of his more notable usages may perhaps be re-
corded with advantage here.

(a) the continual use of qnippe (=‘ you see ') as an equivalent
sor nam, enim, scilicet.

(b) the equally frequent use of celerum, as=sea', aulem.

(c) zpsztnz, ipsos, z'psz'us, (psoram, ipsi, ifisis, where se, sibi,
suus would have been used in the best Latin. This is very
characteristic of Curtius. See note on V111 10§ 1.
