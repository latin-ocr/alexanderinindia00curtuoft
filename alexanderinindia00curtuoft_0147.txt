§g 12—22] NOTES. 143

fitllax miraculum] so Plutarch Alex 62 says πολλὰ πρός δόξαν ἀπα-
τηλιὶ καὶ σοφιστικὰ μηχανώμενος.

§ 20. repetens] ‘retracing '. Compare Livy xxxv 28 ulrum pergere
qua coepisset ire via, an cam qna venisset repetere melius essct. Diodorus
XVII 95 ταῖς αὐταῖς ὁδοῖς πορευθεὶς ἀνέκαμψεν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀκεσίνην ποταμόν.

Coenus] Arrian⁷s account makes Coenus die by the Hydaspes not at
the Acesines, v 29 ἓ 3, w 2 ξ 1.

morte] ‘ at ² or ‘ by reason of’ the death of Coenus. The use of the
ablative here is very remarkable; in lv 10 ξ 3ο we have ingemuisse eliam
:llcxandrmn morli ‘ over the death ⁹.

propter paucos dics etc] fauces and long-am are in emphatic opposition
to each other. ‘ That it was but for the sake os a few days that he had
opened a long—winded speech as though he alone were destined to see
Macedonia again '. visuruszkwogbduevos ⁴ to live to see '. Arrian v 27
ξ 6 makes Coenus use the word ἐπιδεῖν.

ἓ 21. in aqua stabat] ‘was riding [at moorings] in the stream '.
Compare 9 ἓ 19. That is, it was completed and ready sor service.
Diodorus also says that it was in the Acesines, Arrian with much rnore
probability that it xva-s in the Hydaspes. Arrian V 29 ξ 3 tells us that
a city was founded ou the Acesines.

inter llaec] = in terca.

in supplemcutnm etc] Diodorus XVII 05 κατὰ δὲ τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον
ἧκον ἐκ τῆς Ἑλλάδος σύμμαχοι καὶ μισθοφόροι διαὶ τῶν στρατηγῶν η’·γμένοι
πεζοὶ μὲν πλείους τρισμυρίων, ἱππεῖς δ’ οὐ πολὺ λείποντες τῶν ἑξακισχιλίων,
ἐκομίσθησαν ’δὲ καὶ πανοπλίαι διαπρεπεῖς πεζοῖς μὲν δισμυρίοις καὶ πεντα-
κισχιλίοις, φαρμάκων δ’ ἰατρικῶν ἑκατὸν τάλαντα.

milibus] Madvig emends thus, remarking that a7·ma=‘suits of
armour’, and that we ought thus to have armorum..‚caclalormm but
without any reference to the words of Diodorus, which so strongly sup-
port his view.

§ 22. mille] Diodorus also makes the total 1000. Arrian VI 2 ἓ 4
says (following Ptolemy) that counting in all the smaller craft there
were not far short of 2000, and in the Indica 19 ἓ 7 he gives the total
inore precisely at 1800. There is however some doubt about the
reading in these two passages.

discordesque ct...relmcl‹wles] ‘ disagreeiug and raking up old-stand-
ing feuds’. The que...et is one of the quasi-poetical mannerisms of
curtius, and Ξτε...καὶ iu Greek.

Porum et Taxilen] Arrian speaking of the time just after the ‘battle
on the Hydaspes says (V 20 ξ 4) καὶ Ταξίλῃ δὲ διαλλάττει Πῶρον καὶ

Ταξίλην ἀποπέμπει ὀπίσω εἰς τσὶ ἡθη τὰ αὑτοῦ. This may refer to the same
circumstance.

firmatae...rel2'nqm'l] the construction of relinquit here with a geni-
tive of quality following is very remarkable. See however note on
V111 10 ἓ 24 obiecta est. and compare the passage quoted on ξ 2 3 dedicans,
Horace sat 1 4 17, 18 di benefecerunt inopis mc quodque pusilli finxerunt
animi, and see Madvig ξ 287. Render ‘lest them with friendly relations
