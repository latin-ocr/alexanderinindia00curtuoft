arbores] that there was among many nations a worship either os
trees or os unsecn (livinities ‹lu'clling in or among trees, is well known.
See Tacitus Germ 9. 39, 43. Col Sleeinan in his ‘Rambles and
recollections osan Indian official', vol 1¹ cc 12, 13· has a description
os the extraordinary care bestowed on trees in some parts of India,
which reads as isit might be taken to imply a tree-worship. It is
known that the Hindus have sacred trees, such as the Pipal.

capital cst] sor this separate sorm compare vul 4 ἓ ¹7 illis enim in
sella regis consedisse capilalforct. It occurs also in a statute-form in Cic
«le legibus 11 ἓ 21. Curtius seems to have taken a sancy to it as archaic.

ἓ 35. menses] Bohlen quoted by Miitze'll observes that the Indian
months are divided into halves of 15 days each. The name sor such a
hals is paksha; these as Pratt says connnence with the new and sull
moon respectively and are named accordingly. The year is solat.

ἓ 36. mm nl plerique] Curtius evidently means that their 15 (lay
months are reckoned stom hals-moon. not from new to sull and sull to
new. But what authority he had sor this assertion is not so clear.

ct idcirco] the argument is most obscure. What difference to the
length os the months would the difference of starting-point make?

qni [lingunt] this must surely mean ‘those who measure out ’‚ being
probably a translation of some Greek clause beginning with ὅσοι. One
would rather have expected ‹lit-figant, as the relative proposition ex-
pressing the reason of the leading proposition (see Madvig ἕ 366) would
be inore appropriate here.

ἓ 37. haud sane] ‘not at all '. Compare ¹4 ἐξ 3, 46, v 3 § 4
Madatss crat regionispraefi-ctus, haud sane temporum homo, Cic de off
11 ἓ 5 cuius studium qui vituperat haud sane intellego quidnam sit quod
laudaudmn putet.

operae] ‘convenient'. For this see Roby’s grammar vol 11 preface
p xlix and ξ ¹283- He determines it to be a predicative dative (like
surae odio oneri ete), rendering it ‘ matter for attention ². and so mihi non
ss! operae ‘ Ι have not time '. Compare Livy 1 ²4 multisque id verbis,
quac· longo gfflzta carmine non aberae est referre, peragit.

CHAPTER X.

ἓ 1. igilur] this conjunction, commonly expressing a reasonable
inserence (Kennedy ξ 81), is sometimes used as a simple connecting
particle ‘so then' in resuming the narrative aster a digression. Com·
pare Tacitus Agr 13 igilur primus omnium ....... where igitur points
back to the end of chapter 9. Here Curtius refers us to 9§ 1 above.
§ee on 12 ἕ 15 below, and lx 5 ἓ 28.

fines Indiae] Curtius must have followed authorities who reckoned
in India some part of the land to the &Vest os the Indus, though that
river was held to be the boundary of India proper. Arrian does the
same. ·
