LlST OF NAMES. 193

Onesicritus] was appointed pilot of the king's ship or chief pilot ot
the fleet built on the Hydaspes and accompanied Nearchus in that
capacity on the voyage down the Indus and also to the Persian Gulf.
At Susa he was rewarded for his services with a crown. He subse-
quently wrote a history of Alexander which, though he was to a large
extent an eycwitnesS, is chiefly remarkable sor its want of veracity.

Oxyartes] accompanied Bessus in his retreat across the Oxus aster
the murder of Darius, having left his family as he thought secure in a
fortress of Sogdiana. Alexander however stormed the fortress and
having taken thern prisoners designed to marry Roxana his daughter.
On hearing of this Oxyartes gave himself up and met with the kindest
treatment and was appointed satrap of Parapamisus a post which he
continued to hold after the death of Alexander probably until his own

death.

Perdiccas] was one of the greatest of Alexander’s generals and as
after events proved one os the most unscrupulous. See Thirlwall
chapter Lvrr (vol V111 p 221). He was one of the officers called
somatophylakes and also commanded one of the divisions of the pha-
lanx. At the siege of Thebes he was wounded and was present at all
Alexander's great battles. He was subsequently employed both in
the campaigns on the Oxus and in India where he was sent on with
Hephaestion to prepare a bridge sor the army over the Indus, distin-
guished himself in the battle with Porus, and was selected to lead the
assault on the Mallian town where Alexander nearly lost his life. He
married a daughter of the satrap Atropates and his favour with Alex-
ander seems to have been continually on the increase and Alexander's
last act (which was to hand his signet-ring to him) seems to have been
intended to designate Perdiccas as his successor. He was chosen regent
after Alexander's death in conjunction with Meleager and aster many
vicissitudes was fin.111y assas-sinated in Egypt in a campaign against
Ptolemy.

Peucesfies] was appointed to carry the sacred shield which Alex-
ander took down from the temple of Athena at Ilium, and in this
capacity chiefly contributed to save Alexander's life among the Malli.
As a reward for this he was made a somatophylax and appointed
governor of Persia. At Susa he was rewarded with a golden crown.
In 323 Β C he joined Alexantler with 20000 Persian soldiers and was in
close attendance during the king's last illness. He further won Alex-
ander‘s favour by adopting the Persian dress and manners. After the
king's death he was continued in his government of Persia.

Pithon] the commander of the royal household was defeated
wounded and taken prisoner by Spitamenes. He was employed in the
Indian campaign and there received a province. Against the Malli he
held a command and was also sent to put down the revolt of Musicanus.
On the march down the Indus he had charge of a division with the duty
of planting colonies and pacifying the country. After Alexander⁷s death
he retained his province and eventually fell in the battle between
Demetrius and Ptolemy Β C 3¹²·
