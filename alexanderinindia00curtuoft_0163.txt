ἓξ 9—18] NOTES. 159

erant quam quas praeficti modus caperet ‘the affairs were too great to
suit the capacity of a mere subordinate ’0

gloria] glory won.

obsolescit] grows mean or common. Compare Horace carm 11 10
6, 7 caret obsoleti sordibus tecti. See on 1 ἓ 2 above.

in sordidis hostibus] in (a contest with) mean or worthless soes.
ἕ 15. exsatiatus] compare ξ 2 3 laudis satietas.

id est publicae] Curtius strangely says this in his own person, though
it is clear that he is expressing the seelings of Ptolemy and the rest.

ἓ 16. grata etc] Arrian VI ¹3 ἓ 4 says on the contrary (reporting
the account of Nearchus) that Alexander was irritated and vexed at this
remonstrance of his friends, knowing well (so thinks Arrian himself)
that he had deserved the blame impliel in their words.

pietas] affectionate loyalty‚ as often. See Conington on virgil Aen
1 10.

familiarius] with more warmth than usual. So 7 ἓ 2 neglegentius,
85 26, 9 ἓ r and osten.

ἓ 17. altius] that is, he went sar back and reviewed his whole career
in justification of his anibition and rashness. Compare virgil georg
lv 28 5—6 altius omnem expediam prima repetens ab ortgrz‘nejamam.

piissimi] this form of the superlative is rejected by Cic phil
xm ξ 43, who declares that no such form is found in Latin. His
stricture is however most likely in part the result of his hatred for An-
tony who had used it. Anyhow it soon found a place in the language.
Thus Tacitus Agr 4 3 says optimae uxori ct piissimae filiae. The forins
piissimus and pientissimus both occur in inscriptions.

habea] compare 111 6 ξ 17 pro se quisque dextram eius amplexi grates
habebant velut promenti deo.

eo nomine] on that account, viz because....... Compare VII 4 ἓ 10
natura mortalium hoc quoque nomine prava ct sinistra dici potest, quad
in suo quisque negotzb hebetior est quam in alieno, Cic pro Mur ἕ 82 mco
nomine ‘on my own account ’, div in Caec ἓ 19 quo nomine, and many
other places. nemcn=a name or heading in an account-book, hence co
nomine ‘ under that head’ almostzea de causa. So we say in English
⁴ on that account ’‚ ‘ on that score '‚ and so on.

ἓ 18. non cadem etc] the sense is the same as if he had written non
idem cogitant ii...ct ego. ⁴ Their notion is not the same as mine ' means
‘They do not look at the matter from my point of view '-

qui quidem] quz' is the elever restoration of Junius, now generally
accepted by editors. The sense is ‘ inasmuch as ³, like the Greek ὅς γε.

cupiatis] though the subjunctive may be justified as containing an
assumption or admission (Madvig ξ 352), it is probably here influenced
by forsitan, so far at least as the second clause is concerned.

ego me metior] ⁵ but I measure myself not by the span of age but by
that of glory '. The same sentiment is found in ἓξ 19, 22 with a slight
differenee of expression. There is no disjunctive particle after ego, and
