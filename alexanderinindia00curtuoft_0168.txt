g ¹7· in [onvive'o] at this particular banquet3 opposed to the

llorratas] Diodorus xvn 100 gives an οεοῦ-11η of this affair almost
word sor word the same as that of Curtius, but gives the same Mace·
donian the name Κόρα-γος. See Tac hist 11 68.

d {vostea-0 die] Diodorus says that the king appointed a (lay sor the
uc .

tandem] at last, that is, aster the duel.

vcl...z·el] in the proper sense, as connected with the root of volo.
The logical order- of the sentence is obscured by the necessary repetition
of de, sor the sense is de (vel sua temeritate vel illim ignavia) = in direct
speech ‘on (call it my rashness or your cowardice)'.

liic is the MSS reading. for which Hedicke accepts Jeep's conjecture
vis. [The emendation conventus erat sor convenerat found in ἰ MSS is
my own. I believe the word multitudo found in the same MSS to have
arisen from a comment on conventus. For the latter word in the simple
sense of ‘meeting’ compare lv 5 § 11 isdem stre dicbus solemne erat
ludicrum Isthmiorum, quod conventu totius Gracc-iae celebratur, Cic 11
in Verrem lv ἓ 107 fi'stos dies anniversarios aqnnt celeberrimo virorum
