and generosity too ostentatious, and his clemency too exclu-
sively the result of calculation: but judged by the standard of
his own day these would pass sor unmixed heroic virtues. His
ambition seems to us somewhat deformed by a too ready ac-
ceptance of flattery and by the vanity which led him to claim
a divine origin. But to find fault with such weaknesses1 in a
young conqueror situated as he was is merely saying that he
was a man. His tender affection for Hephaestion, and the un-
wavering love he bore to the high-spirited mother‘2 from whom
he inherited his sels-willed and ambitious temp-31·ament‚shew

(12) If we try Alexander by a test commonly applied to
great kings—the permanence of their work—we shall not find
him wanting. That his vast empire, won as it was by only
ten years of conquest, should have fallen to pieces when the
master's hand³ was so untimely withdrawn‚ is no blot on his
same: it could not have held together. But that any of his

Macedonian origin. The Greeks at home had long lost the
power⁵ of combining to form a really powerful state3 and it

3 Plutarch has preserved a neat remark made at the time, that the
Macedonian army on losing its· leader resembled the Cyclops with his

one eye put out.

or Sekander in Asia, and for the Baktrian kingdom, see Marco Polo 1

Alexander’s suecessors in Baktria and India by A von Sallet.

⁵ The general decay of Greek life and feeling at this time is vividly
described by Mommsen in his History of Rome bk 111 c 14.
