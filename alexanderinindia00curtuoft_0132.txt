128 Q. CURTI RUFI HJSI: ALEX. [tx 1

aurcis] isthese were gold Philips (Horace epist 11 r ²34) they would
be worth about 165 each, if Persian darics (δαρεικοὶ) about aguinea.
But they may have been neither.

§72 ncqnc enim..salvativum] ‘sor' said he ‘I cannot live without
the power os a king and this 1 should not enjoy as a prisoner '. cap-
tivum stands where in Greek we should have a present participle.

§8. nuntiari etc] Arrian says in effect just the same (v 20 5 6),
Diodorus xvil 90 only observes καταπληξάμενος ἠνάγκασε ποιεῖν τὸ
προσταττόμενον.

porro] ‘further on’. It seems better to read thus, than Poro with
the best 3155 ; a reading which the commentators have vainly striven
to torture at once into Latin and sense.

amne] must refer to the Acesines (Chenab). Perhaps Accsine has
fallen out before amne. Arrian v 20 ἐξ 8, 9 speaks of the crossing of
this river at some length, as it had received special notice from Ptolemy.
3ut Diodorus xvtl 90 goes on in the same way αὐτὸς δὲ μετὰ τῆς δυνά·
μεως περάσας τὸν ποταμὸν προῆγε διὰ. χώρας ἀρετῇ διαφερούσης. It seems
probable therefore that he and Curtius are both here depending on the
same writer whose handling of the matter somehow led them into the
grave blunder of omitting an important name.

ξ 9. silvae etc] so Diodorus goes on δένδρων γὰρ εἶχε γένη διαλλάτ-
τοντα καὶ τὸ μὲν inpos ἔχοντα πηχῶν ἑβδομήκοντα τὸ δὲ πάχος μβγις ὑπὸ
τεττάρων ἀνδρῶν περιΧαμβανόμενα τριῶν δὲ πλέθρων σκιὰν ποιοῦντα.

projoe in inmensum spatium]:iu spatium prope inmensum, over an
almost boundless tract os country.

ξ 10. plerique rami etc] the tree here described is the Banyan, one
os the most celebrated Indian trees, as well known to the ancients as it
has been in modern times. Strabo xv 1 ς’ 21 gives a description from
Onesikritus and also Aristobulus. See also Theophrast hist plant lv 4
§4, Pliny N H XI1§§22, 23, Arrian Indica 11 ς’ 7.

instar] Madvig§ 280 obs 6, Kennedy ἓ 166, τ.
rursus] goes of course with cqufcbantmn

qua se cumam-rant] at the point where they had bent themselves;
at any point, that is, where they took an upward bend from the ground.
The clause is obscurely put in. but the sense is pretty certain in itself,
and is established by the words in Strabo (δένδρα) ὦν τοὺς κλάδους αὐξη·
θέντας ἐπὶ πήχεις καὶ δώδεκα ἔπειτα τήν λοιπὴν αὔξησιν καταφερῆ λαμ-
βάνειν ἀς ἂν κατακαμπτομένους, ἕως ἂν ἅψωνται τῆς ’γῆς’ ἔπειτα κατὰ,
’γῆς διαδοθέντας ῥιζοῦσθαι ὁμοίως ταῖς κατώρινξιν, εἶτ’ ἀναδοθέντας στελε-
χοῦσθαι.

ε)ἰ;;*ι’ῠαιιίιιν] would shoot up straight again. Compare v111 ιι § 6.

§IL caclt'..jbnl1'bus] compare lv 7 ἓξ 16, 17 (os the temple os
Ammon) tandem ad sedem consecratam dvo ventum cst. incredibile dictu,
inter vastas solitudines sita undique auehit-ntitas ramis, ῑνιζτ in densam
umbram cadente sole, contecta cst ,· multique sontes dulcibus aquis passim
manantibus alunt silvas. cacli quaque mira temper-iss verno tepori
maxime similis omncs anni partes pari salubritate percurrit.
