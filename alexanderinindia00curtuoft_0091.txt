NOTES.

BOOK VIII, CIIAPTER IX.

ἓ ῐ. ηε...αἶειέί] Curtiis, like Lixy and other rhetorical historians,
gives the motivcs of actions with the utmost confidence.

natum] sor the construction compare Terence adelph 545 nisime
credo lzuic esse nasum rei, flrzmdis miseriis, Horace de art poet 82
natum rebus agendis. For the matter see Curtius VI ‘z ἕ 15 rzmecr,
otiosi militis vitium.

in Indiam movit] Arrian IV 22 ξ 3 says in much the same sense
προύχώρει ὼς ἐπὶ Ἰνδούς. For movil intransitive or=movit casla‘a com-
pare V 13 ξ ι audito Dareum movisse ab Ecbatanis, lx 4 ἓ 27, Livy xxx
59 ἓ 6, xxii 1 ξ 1.

sc771pcr...clam'or] this dry remark is particularly suggested by the
matter of the four chapters just preceding, namely the unjnst accusation
and death of the sophist Kallisthenes. Curtius means that Alexander
did himself no credit by his acts during an interval of rest. For clarior
compare lx 8 ἓ 23·

ἓ 2. spectat orientem] ‘lies towards the East’. Curtius speaks
srom the point of view of one coming from centra] Asia as Alexander
did. That the above rendering is correct seems to be shewn by VII 10
{i 15 circa eam VI oppidis condendis electa sedes cst, duo ad meridiem
versa, quattuor spectantia orez-ntem, VIII ¹05 ει 3, Vt 6 ξ 23 praerupta
rupes es! qua spectat occidentem, and other such passages. Pratt renders
‘slopes eastward'‚ but his reasons seem weak. We must remember
that the ancients knew very little of India [see Strabo xv 1 ἓξ 1—12],
and that Eratosthenes [in Strabo XV Ι ἕ 11] evidently makes the Indus
ssow north and south, and places the southern angle of the rhomboid to
which he likens India a good way to the east of the northern one. See
also Ari-ian Indica 3.

in latitudz'nmz...recta regione] ‘ broadways ’...‘ straightways ², that is
⁴ in breadth ' and ‘ straight ahead ‘z ‘in length ². 'I‘hat writers disfered.
some reckoning the length from north to south and the breadth from
east to west. while others adopted the contrary arrangement, is clear
from Arrian Indica 3. Curtius seems to reckon the length from east
to west. See on § 6 rubro mari. For in latitudinem compare Vll
