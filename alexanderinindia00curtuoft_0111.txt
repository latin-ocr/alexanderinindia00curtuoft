the plains around them. But those built in commanding and elcvatcd
positions are all constructcd of brit-ks and clay' (ἐκ πλίνθου τε καὶ
πηλοῦ). This πλίνθος seems to be os the same kind, a sort of ‘adobefi

ut] :ila ul as osten.
terra lenum-c diluta] :the πηλὸς mentioned by Arrian.

ς 26. unit-ersa] ‘all at once', referring to materia both durior and
smrgilis.
consideret] settle down, sink. Compare Virgil Aen 11 624, Ix 145.

inpositae etc] ‘strong heams had been placed upon it, and on them
sloors had been laid covering the walls and affording a passage along
them'. How this arrangement was to prevent the upper part of the
wall from settling down is a mystery as the text stands: and we can
only suppose that (α) Curtius lias not understood his authorities, or (b)
has lest out some important steps in the description, or (c) that the text
is mutilatcd so as to conceal his real meaning.

ξ 27· consilii inccrtmzz] here we have the so-called genitive of
respect. See Kennedy§ 173 D, and compare below 11 ξ 3, 13§ 17, IX
3 ξ 18.

aggwc] with a bank or mole, as he had done on a grander scale at
the siege of Tyre.

aliter] ‘otherwise’ than by filling up the hollows in the manner just
spoken of. Compare 11 ς’ 7.

percussit] Arrian IV 26 ἓ 4 says τοξεύεται μὲν ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ἐς τὸ
σφυρὸν οὐ χαλεπῶς.

§aS.t11ms07-le] we have kept the old reading here in preference
to the conjecture of Jeep adopted by Hedicke. Zumpt explains the
tum here by referring to the frequent wounds received by Alexander in
different parts of his body.

suram] Curtius' account slightly differs from that of Arrian.

iussit] we see that he had previously been on soot, which is also
implied by Arrian, who says προσῆγε τῷ τείχει τὴν φάλαγγα.

oblzgrato] ‘without even bandaging his wound’. The ob implies the
putting of a bandage over the place. Compare obducere in ξ 31 and
13 ξ 2 5. ·

destinata] what he had made up his mind to do, ‘his plans'. Com-
pare 1X 7 b 18 and above 9 ξ 23.

ἓ ²9· ῥήξω-[ρης vulnus] ‘the gradual cooling of the wound'.

lovis filium] the son of Ammon, who had greeted him as such when
he visited his oracle in the desert, at least so Alexander allowed his
tlatterers to declare. See Plutarch Alex 27, 28, who says that Alex-
ander was not vain enough to believe in this fiction himself, but coun-
tenanced it as a means of impressing the minds of the Orientals. He
adds that when shot with an arrow (perhaps on this occasion) he tumed
in his pain to his friends and said τοῦτο μὲν, ὦ φίλοι, τὸ ῥέον αἷμα καὶ
οὐκ ἰχὼρ οἶός πέρ τε ῥέει μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν, a quotation from Iliad
vv 340.
