ignaris] being only acquainted with the practically tidclcss shores os
the Mediterranean.

§ 9. tertia] by Roman recl<oning=9 a m with us.

stata] fixed, ‘ periodical ². Lucan x 240 of the west winds affecting

the Nile quorum stata tempora-flatus, and below ξ 27.

exaestuans] ‘rising in tlood-tide', ‘flowing’. Arrian Vt 19 ἓξ 1. 2.

in his sar more sober account os the incident, says that they were first
troubled by the ebb and then yet more sorely by the ssoods, which
sounds more likely than (see §S 19, 20 below) the account of Curtius.
Diodorus says nothing of it. Burnes vol 111 c 1 gives a description of
the violent tides of the Indus esrum-y, shewing that all the main details
of this account are quite in accordance with facts.

intelle] to assail, ‘burst upon’ them. Arrian says ἀθρόου ἐπελθόντος
του κυματος.

coercitum] ‘ checked ’ in its course.

adversmn] adjective of course, meaning ‘ up against its natural flow ’.

torrentia] flumina, ‘ rivers in flood ⁷.

ἓ 10. identidem] ‘over and over again '‚ hence ‘continuously '-
‘every instant ’. So ἕ 21, 4ξ 18, Catullus 49 (51) of the youth gazing
upon his mistress qni sedens adversus identidem te spectat et audit dulce
rulentem.

ἓ 1 1. trepide] in a hurry.
ἓ 12. festinatio etc] ‘ more haste less speed ’, as we say.

tage of referring to the men, not the ships (which are not in question as
subject of any verb till aliae gv 13). Compare Virgil Aen 111 289 consi-
dere transtris, IV 573, V 136 etc. The sense of the whole will then be
‘some were pushing the vessels with poles, others had taken their seats
[to row] but [in their crowding and scrambling] had meanwhile been
preventing the orderly shipping of the oars ’. The description of this
scene of confusion is graphic, though at first sight somewhat difficult-

g 13. enavckare] to sail out into the clear channel.

clauda] crippled, lame. The meaning is that more oars were man-
ned on the one side than on the other, as in virgil V 271 ordine debilis
uno. For the word claudus see Lucretius IV 436, Livy XXXVII 24,
Tacitus ann 11 ²4·

moliebantur] were ‘working' them feebly.

non receperant] had not taken on board, that 15, had not been able
