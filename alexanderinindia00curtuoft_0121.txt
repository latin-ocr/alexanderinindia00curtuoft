Hypanis and back again (και ἐπειδὴ καταβᾶσιν ἐπὶ τὸν ’Ὑδάσπην και
νικήσασι Πωρον ὁδὸς ην ἐπὶ τὸν Ὕπανιν πρὸς ἕω κάκεῖθεν ἐπὶ τὸν Ὑδάσπην
πάλιν, ὕεσθαι συνεχῶς καὶ μάλιστα τοῖς ἐτησίαις). It would seem theu
that Alexander reached the Hydaspes early 111 May and crossed the river
and defeated Porus about the middle of that mouth (end of Munychion).
As Miitzell remarks, the accounts of modern travellers shew that the
river could then be crossed; a mouth later it would hardly be possible.
It seems then that Curtius speaks of the greatness os the river more as
a rhetorician than as an historiam though the width assigned (about
ξ,- mile) is no great distance and hardly if at all exaggerated.

he is really thinking of lfflnlaspcs. 50 in 14 ἓ 40 we have eo though
belua has gone before, sor he is thinking of elssplmntm. Zumpt. The
personification of the river in this passage suits well nith this view.

§9. n τε] yet not. Compaie ¹4 ἓ 10.

pro spatio] pro=⁴in proportion to'‚ ‘according to ’. So κατεῖ with
accusative in Greek. Compare lx 1 ξ 6, 4ἓ 14, and for spatium rx 2
3· 17.

stag-nantium] Mutzell remarks that this word (see on 9 ξ 7) is not
appropriately used here. Compare lx ἐ ξ 12.

tumens et elzsus] ⁴ boiling and compiessed'. elzsus= throttled‚
sqoeezed. For the use of the u ord 111 speaking of a river compare lx 2
s* 17, and generally IX 2 ξ 21, 7 ξ 22. lhe sense is nell illustrated by
Pomponius Mela 111 5 of the Araxes. Miitzell remarks that the name
of this river 111 Sanskrit is Vitasta (lljvdaspcs), which means ⁴ arrow-
swift ’.

occulta saxa] this mention of hidden rocks in the bed of the Hydas-
pes has led some observers to fix the point of Alexander's passage some-
where by the village of Jhelam. But General Cunningham rather
inclines to the other place of crossing at Jalalpur. Old lines of high
road run to both these points. The mention of the rocks by Curtius is
not in itself decisive of anyffling, and the insulae in ξ 12 may corne out
os another account and be no more than the saxa from another point of
view,

repercussae] ‘beaten back’ in eddies. Compare 9 ἓ 8 and v Ι 4 ἓξ 4.

ξ 10. vastorum] Miitzell refers to IV 13 ἓ 5 where Parmenio is
made to attribute to the Scythians and Bactrians eximiam vastorum
magyu'tudinem corporum. Compare Ix 2 ἐξ 19, 21.
