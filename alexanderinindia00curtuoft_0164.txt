160 Q. CURTJ RUFI IIIST. ALEX. [1x6

sslflcomrw is effected by co-ordination, as osten: see Mayor on Cic
p i 11§ 110.

ξ 19. paternis] that is, the kingdom os his father Philip.

per oliam corporis] ‘in a lise of bodily ease’. Compare 8 ἓ 26 per
quietem. pcr=⁴in a course οῖ’, a sense in which Tacitus is fond of
using it. See Agricola 4 per omnem honestarum artium cultum, 6 pet·
mutuam caritatem, hist v 10 proximus annus civili bello intentus quan·
tum acl ludams jvcr otium transiit.

ne6pz‘gri quidem etc] sor the sentiment compare Horace carm 111 2
13—1 .

occztpal] takes them unawarcs.

T Ὶὲ 12¹9. Alacdc's] these wcre a Thracian tribe not sar srorn the
rl )8. l-

rubro mart] the Indian ocean, as usual.

subluitur] ‘is washed below’. This may refer to the washing of the
lower part of the coast-line by the sea, but more probably indicates that
lhe rubrum mare formed the southern boundary of Asia. The ancients
osten speak of the north as above and the south as below. For the
word compare Caesar bell Gall Vll 69.

orbem] compare Juvenal x 168 os Alexander unus Psllaeo iuveni non
szffcit orbis.

aperire] to open up. Tacitus Agr 22 tertius expeditionum annus
novas gentes apernit.

ἓ 2 r. Europae] this refers to the crossing of the Jaxartes to attack
the Scythians. So in Vix 7 ἐξ 2, 12, ¹3 we find the river mentioned as
the boundary of Europe and Asia, and in ἓ 13 Alexander is made to say
unus amnis r'ntmsszcz't, quem sitraicimus, in E uropam arma proferimus.
The river is there it is true called Tanais, but Arrian 111 30 ἐξ 7, 8 well
shews that there were two rivers of that name and that the Jaxartes is
really meant. Indeed he quotes Aristobulus in support of his state-
mentS. See Schuyler's 'l'urkistan c 6 (ι p 236).

momento] compare Horace sat 1 1 7-8 horae momento cita mors
venit aut victoria lacta.

post] aster, that is, on attaining. Instanccs will be found in
Madvig ἓ 276 obs 6.

nonum] this is one year, and vz'crsimmn alque octavum two years
too little. But a historian trained in rhetorical schools would think
nothing of straining a point os chronology in order to make the more of
his hero’s exploitS. So Tacitus Agr 33 has ortavus annus, 34 quin·
quaginta amm, both rhetorical exaggerations.

excolenda] working up, completing. Compare Tacitus dial ἠ (of
Cicero) primus enim excoluit orationem.

ego vero] introduces. the denial with emphasis. Madvig ἓ 454 obs 1.
in theatro] that is, before the eyes of the world, with all mankind
