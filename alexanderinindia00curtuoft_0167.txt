7 gg 1—16] NOTES. 163

ἓ ῐῐ. a rege] Alexandro.

revertit] Diodorus XVII 99 says that they never reached their homes,
but after suffering great hardships on the way were cut to pieces by the
Macedonians aster the death of Alexander.

ἓ 12. duarum] the Sudrakae and Malli are meant.

rftagytt'tudr'm] ablative of quality or description.

limae] see on V111 9 ξ 15.

ξ 13. libertam-m] Arrian Vt 14 ἓξ 1—-3 in speaking of this episode
says that they claimed to have been tree since the time of the eastern
conquests of Dionysus (Lz'llcrpater in Curtius).

ἓ 14. pensitabat] as they were a free people, this cannot mean that
they had been and were in the habit of paying tribute to any other
power, and must be a remark of Curtius' own, stating that they
used to pay it at one time; ‘and laid on them the tribute which the
two tribes actually paid to (the satrap os) the Arachosians'. Perhaps
however the text is corrupt, and we should rather read pensitaret.
Arrian only says that they submitted to Alexander and offered to pay
tribute, and that Alexander set Philippus over them as satrap.

pensitabat] paid in instahnents.

imperat] Arrian says that 116 demanded 1000 of their chief men as
hostages. If Curtius means these (which is very doubtful) then cqztitcs
must be taken to denote men of high standing, a Roman notion derived
from the Roman ordo equester. But Arrian further says that they sent
him besides of their own accord 500 war—chariots with their comple-
ment ofmen. It is probable therefore that Curtius has confused two
parts of the account given in his authorities, unless indeed they had
done the same before him. See below 8 ἐ 1.

ξ 15. modsce's] :‘small'‚ as usual. The close packing of the
couches shews the great number of guestS.

aulaea] tapestry curtains. So in VIII 5 ἓ 21 of Alexander overhear-
ing the speech of Kallisthenes uec qzticqzram corum quae invicem iactam
crant rcx Ignorabat, cum post aulaea quae lectis obduxerat staret.

710ῖά inmutatione] ‘ by their new-sangled change (of manners) ⁹.
That is, their adoption of Oriental customs and dress.

corruijn] ‘tainted’. Compare V 1 ξ 36 nillil urbis cius corruptius
moribm, and below IX 9 ἓ 6 of the sea-water.

ἓ 16. virtutem virium] ‘excellence of his strength’2his excellent

strength. As virtus like ἀρετὴ can be used sor any sort of excellence,
there is no need to find fault with this strange phrase.

iam] so the MSS, and it is surely as good as the correction eliam.
We can hardly find in the latter an allusion to Alexander's dislike of

athlehes in general (Plut Alex 4). Some editors· omit the word al-
toget er.

increpabant] used to carp at him, saying....
saginati emporis] genitive of quality or description, here part of the
predicate and parallel to inutilem. ‘That they had a full-fed good-
