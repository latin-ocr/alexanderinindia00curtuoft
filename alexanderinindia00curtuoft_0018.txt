14 INTRODUCTJON.

(A) the misplacement os quoque, very common in Livy.

(c) the omission of the demonstrative before the relative
'(qm'=ci qui and so on), even where some obscurity is caused
therebv.

(s) the frequent ending of a sentence with a participle or
adjective.

(g) the sudden change (or omission) of the subject of the
sentence.

(lt) the frequent use of the future participle active (usurus
etc) to express a purpose.

(i) a certain looseness in the use of the ablative absolute,
where a parenthetic or additional clause would have been better
sor both sound and sense.

(lc) the use of the pluperfect=perfect with an adverb (such
as pallulis-per etc). See v111 12 ξ 17, 13 ἓ 11, 14 ξ 23, lx 6 ξ 22,
7§20‚8§6‚9§§ 14, 23·

(l) the preference shewn sor the construction with the plu-
perseet active over the simpler passive construction. So V111 13
ξ 10 quam compleverant etc rather than quae completa erat etc.
See also 1x 1 §5 29, 33, 4 ξ 30, 7 ξ 15, 8 ξ 22, 9§ 19. In some
cases the effect is thus rather more viv-id, in others the usage is
inappropriate and affected.

(m) the occasionally strange order of words. See V111 12 ξ 10,
14 ἐξ Ι3, 14-
(n) the use of poetical language.

It must not be supposed that these usages are peculiar to
Curtius. On the contrary they are for the most part manncrisms
common to him with Livy and other writers, and only take the
attention as they do srorn the want of Livian brilliancy to carry
them off. And if he is less pleasant than Livy to read he is also

less difficult.

(5) Curtius has since the revival of learning down to re-
cent times been a popular author, and has been repeatedly
edited by scholars on the continent. But so entirely has he
passed out of the notice of our schools that this will possibly be
