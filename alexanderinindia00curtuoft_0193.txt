shew care and acuteness. Their dcscriptions of the country are accurate,
but they did not penetrate into the inner lise of the people. One thing
we may gather from thern, that distinctions os caste had not as yet
appeared in the Punjab, and that in this point (as also in respect of the
system of government) the civilisation of the Punjab was essentially
different from that of the Gangetic einpire as described a few years later
by Megasthenes, when Sandrokottos was on the throne. This prince,
known to the Hindus as Chandragupta, ruled over a great populous and
wealthy country: there caste institutions had long prevailed; the court
was of rather a Tartar than an Aryan type, with its intrigues and con-
spiracies, its pompous ceremonies, and its hosts of women and body-
guards round the person of the Raja. Espionage was the chief engine
of government. The religion of the people was Brahmanical‚ but the
Buddhists had then made some progress, and there is reason to think
that the Raja was himself a convert to Buddhism. [It is to be gathered
that the later writers in borrowing from Megasthenes did not understand
the variety of customs and institutions in India, and (as possibly Curtius
V111 9) applied what was meant for the Hindus of the Ganges valley to
those of the Punjab.]

(f) [ΜΓ Wheeler remarks that the story told in Curtius lx 2
ἓξ 6-7 is a scandal unworthy of credit. It is, he says, simply the
oriental form of abuse, which is directed not against the individual but
against his mother and other female relatives. But he represents the

tale as told to Alexander at Taxila by Sandrokottos ¹. On what authority
he makes the two meet at all, and how he brings the latter to Taxila, 1
cannot discover. Μι- McCrindle on the contrary makes the story to be
told qs Sandrokottos; at least he says that the Ξανδράμης of Diodorus
XVII 93 and the Agrammes of Curtius are to be identified with him, and
that the names are mere distortions of form. The last is a bold
remark]

¹ Is it possible that SIsikottos may have been meant here?
[1 find that Mr Hunter‚ pp 144, 160, also identifies Sislkottos and
Sandrokottos. W E H July 1882.]
