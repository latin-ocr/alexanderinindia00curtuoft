INTRODUCTION.

A. Curtius and lais bools.

(Ι) Of Quintus Curtius Rufus the author of the work
before us we know perhaps less than of any other writer
ancient or modern whose name has come down to us with
his book. We know nothing whatever as to who he was,
unless indeed we identify him with the adventurer spoken
ofl by Tacitus and the younger Pliny under the same name.
But this has been so gravely questioned by Orelli Nipperdey
and Teuffe12 that it would not be safe to assume it here. This
however is not all: we are not certain even as to the time
at which he wrote, and shall have to content ourselves with
probabilities. On the very meagre and obscure evidence of
a passage in the tenth book <9 ἓξ 3—6) the date of the com-

1 Tac ann Χῖ 20, 21, Plin epp VH 27. It is argued that Tacitus
would have mentioned his wrhings, had he been speaking of the present
Curtius. But he seems not to have mentioned those of Corbulo and
Frontinus, of whom he speaks3 and here there is no question as to the
personal identity. Again it is said that our writer in describing battles
shews ignorance of military matters, and so cannot have been the man
who was proconsul of Africa. Is this inserence so very certain? It
might further be asked‚ would so mean-born a man as the proconsul
have had the rhetorical training that our author clearly had? Might
this not have been the very means whereby he gained the praetorship
which he held before the proconsulate?
