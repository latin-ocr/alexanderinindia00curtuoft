§ 5. maxime in ripa] no doubt sor the convenience of being near
the water.

perhaps suggested it.

oppido] Diodorus gives preeisely the same account. Ari-ian VI 15
ἓ 2 speaks of Alexander's ordering a town to be built at the confluence
of the Acesines and Indus. lf this (as is probable) be the same as is
meant by Curtius, we have here another instance of the latter⁷s confused

Mithan Kot-

pectus voluisse. See Madvig ἓ 400 c obs.

the mutiny. Arrian says nothing of this.

iure amoris] Alexander had married his daughter Roxana.

amplioris z'mperz'z] Arrian says that he received the government
of the Parapamisadae from which Tiryaspes had been deposed.
