192 LJST OF NAMES.

Hephaestion] was about Alexander's own age and his most intimate
friend. He does not appear to have possessed any marked abiisty, and
this perhaps was one reason sor Alexander's affection towards him.
We find him crowning the tomi) os Patroclus in the Troad as Alexan-
der did that of Achilles. In the Egyptian expedition he was in com-
mand os the ficet, and he received a wound at Gaugamela. At the
trial of Philotas he was one of the three presitlents and aster the death
of Philotas succeeded with Cleitus to the joint command of the horse-
guards. He was subsequently employed in important operations in
Sogdiana and Bactria and accompanied Alexander to India, where
again we continually find him charged with the conduct os great opera-
tions. He shared with Perdiccas the task of preparing a bridge over
the Indus, was sent to occupy the kingdom of the lesscr Porus, led a
division during the invasion os the territory of the Malli, and com·
manded half the army during the descent of the Indus. From this it
would appear that he had acquired sufficient military experience to
compensate sor his want of striking ability. After this he was occu-
pied with the building os several citics and when separated from the
king it was on him that the command of the whole army devolved.
On his return to Susa he married Drypetis a daughter os Darius and
sister of Statira. Soon afterwards he was taken with a sever at Ecba-

tana and there died receiving aster death the most extravagant honours
froin the affection of Alexander.

Leonnatus] was one of the ablest and most distinguished of Alex-
ander’s officers. He was a somatophylax and on several occasions
shewed the greatest courage, notably at the siege of the Mallian town
where with Peucestes he saved Alexander's lise. On the march down
the Indus he commanded the light troops and was left at the mouth of
that river with most of the troops and the smaller vessels. On the
return march from India he was lest to overawe the Oritae and to wait
sor the arrival of Nearchus. For these services he was rewarded with a
golden crown. After Alexander’s death Lesser or Hellespontine Phry-
gia fell to his share.

meleager] vias present at Alexander’s battles of the Granicus
Issus and Gaugamela and took part in the operations in Bactria. At
the passage of the Hydaspes he was in command of mercenaries.
After Alexander's death he led the opposition against Perdiccas by
whom he was put to death.

Memnon] was appointed governor of Syria and subsequently
brought up reinforcements sor Alexander from Thrace.

nearchus] was in command of the fleet on the voyage down the
Indus, srom the mouth of which river he was sent round with a fleet on
a voyage of survey to the Persian Gulf and arrived sate at Carmania
aster meeting with Leonnatus at Oritis, visiting the Persian Gulf. and
finally landing near the island of Ormuz. From here he proceeded to
explore the mouth of the river Tigris. At Susa he was married to a
daughter of Mentor by Barsine, who had also had a son by Alexander
(by name Hercules) whose claims to the throne were supported by
Nearchus in the council held aster the death os Alexander.
