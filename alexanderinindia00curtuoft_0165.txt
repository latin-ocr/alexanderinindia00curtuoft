fircl] for this word meaning ‘lead ' ‘guide '‚ especially in speaking
of the tendency or course os destiny, see Conington on Virgil Aen 11 34
scu iam Troiae st'cslzla jbrchant.

longam] it is worth noticing that in a similar context (Agr 44)
Tacitus einploys this adjective to aid in expressing what Curtius here
renders by multam: <os Agricola) ct {fise quidem, quamquam medio 2¹12
spatio integrae aetatis ereptus, quantum aa' gloriam, longissimum aevum
peregit.

ἓ 26. olim] goes with agitatae z'n auimo mco, and means ‘ for a long
time⁷, a sense which it osten bears in silver-age Latin. See Mayor

Hence the words seem to imply the making a mortal into an immortal.
