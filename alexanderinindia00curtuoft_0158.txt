¹54 Q. CURTI RUFI HJSJ: ALEX. [1x5

ἐτέρας κλίμακος προσαναβάς πρῶτος ὑπερήσπισε τὸν βασιλέα, and Arrian
VI 9 ἓ 3 makes him mount directly aster the king and hythe same
ladder. Clearly then Curtius writing loosely and starting with an inac-
curate conception has merely written oppidi when according to his
authorities he should have said muri, sor he only means what Diodorus
says, viz that the man mounted by another ladder.

§ 15. solacium] the meaning has to be stretched a little in order to
sit it to vilae. There is in fact a sort os zeugma here. ‘Not to succour
him in lise but to comfort him in his death‘.

clepoo...cxccpit] that is, he gave way and fell over on his shield.

Timacus] Plutarch Alex 63 speaks of one Λιμναῖος, Arrian speaks
οἵἈΒρέας, and there was altogether a great diversity in the accounts as
to the names of those who fought so well on this day. See ἓ 21 below
and Arrian VI ιι ἐξ 7, 8.

Leonnatus] according to Arrian he. mounted next aster Peucestes
by the same ladder.

Aristonus] Arrian VI 28 ξ 4 mentions Ἀριστόνους as one of the
original seven σωματοφύλακες of Alexander, the addition os Peucestes to
whom (Πευκέστας in Arrian) made the number eight. But Curtius
alone mentions him on this occasion.

ξ 16. edita] compare VIII 14 ξ 37, and VII 7 ξ 37 in medios hostes
se inmisit et memorabili edita pugna obrutus telis est, VIII 2 ξ 37 nobilem
edidit pugnam regemque ‘comtninus cum hoste dimicantem protexit.
Render ‘ aster a gallant struggle’.

ἓ 18. clipeum] from Arrian VI 9 ξ 3, 10§ 2 (compared with ῐ 11
ξέ 7, 8) we learn that this was the sacred shield taken down by Alex-
ander srom the temple of Athena at Ilium, which was borne before him
in sight by his immediate body-guards.

ξ 19. perfregere] the wall was earthen according to Ari-ian VI ιο
ξ 3 ‘ some driving pegs into the wall (which was of earth), hung on by
them and were with difficulty crawling up'.

moliti] where they had formed an entrance (by breaking the wall).
See on VIII 10 ἕ 3ο, and sor moliri aditum compare V1 6 ἓ 28 multam
materiam ceciderat miles, aditum per saxa molitus.

ξ 20. parentatum est] ‘they satisfied their righteous anger'. pa-
rentare strictly means to avenge A by the destruction os B. Compare
v 6 ἓ 1 (of the contemplated burning of Persepolis) excidio illius paren-
tandum esse maioribus, VII 2 ἓ ²9 omniumque sanguine duci parenta-
turos, Caesar bell Gall VII 17 etc. What is specially remarkable in our
present passage is that we have the word metaphorically used. not of
satisfying by vengeance the spirit of a dead person, but of glutting the
wrath of the soldiers at the wounding of their king who was not
dead.

521. Ptolomaeum etc] Arrian VI 11 §8 τὸ δὲ δὴ μέγιστον πλημμέ-
λημα τῶν ξυγγραψάντων τὰ ἀμφὶ Ἀλέξανδρον ἐκεῖνο τίθεμαι ἔγωγε.
Πτολεμαῖον ’γάρ τὸν Λάγου ἔστιν οἳ ἀνέγραψαν ξυναναβῆναί τε Ἀλεξάνδρῳ
’.ατὰ τὴν κλίμακα ὁμοῦ Πευκέστᾳ καὶ ὑπερασπίσαι κειμένου καὶ ἐπὶ τῳδε
