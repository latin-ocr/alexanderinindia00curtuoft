mon in Latin writers. but sounds oddly in treating os a Greek subject.
See Virgil Aen vm 679.

ἓ 10. nc admirari quidem] the impliecl antithesis is, as Vogel re-
Ξέἷέςζῧίιῑιέῐίιῖἴξ ιἠιίιζςιιανί, ‘could not even think it strange [much less find

paria] ‘ matched ' ε the one as great as the other.

is bought. See Matlvig§ 258, Kenncdys' 147.

§ η. rct'] the deadly peril of Alexander, described in the last
chapter.

inertissimas] the hands of the greatest laggards or cowards. In 2
ἓ 26 we had inertia in the sense of ‘ want of enterprize '. Here iners is
a trifle stronger. Both shades of meaning are common in other writers.
'she original meaning appears in Lucilius frag >uu 12 ut perhibetur
iners, ars in quo non erit ulla.

then the Roman Censors in virtue of their office affixed a mark to the
name of a citizen on the roll, that citizen lost certain political and social

and (as here) metaphorically. See Cic pro Cluentio ἓ 117.

admitteret] this verb is used with such words as maleficium, dedecus,
facinus etc almost in the sense os ‘ commit’. Compare Vl 7 5 32faven-
tem habes iudicem, sz' quod admitti non oportuit saltem purgari potest,
(lic de off 111 ξ 95. A common construction is admittere in se ‘to bring
upon oneself‘‚ which well shews how the notion of guilt came to be im-
plicd. See Cic phil 11 ἐ ⁴7·

praestare] srom the sense of ⁴ to secure ' or ‘ guarantee ' we have the
force of the word extended so as to irnply precaution‚ like cavere orpro-
videre.

alio modo] these are the emphatic words in the sentence. If, says
