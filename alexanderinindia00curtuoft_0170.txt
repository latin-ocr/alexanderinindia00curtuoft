166 Q. CURTJRUFJ JIJSZ ALEX. [1x7ggz5—-26

coniectum etc] Diodorus says ὁ δὲ θεωριὶἷν τήν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν συνδρομὴν
τῶν Μακεδόνων τότε μὲν ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ πότου.

§26. graviter etc] Diodorus says that be was vcxed at the man’s
death and longed for him when it was too late, and ἔμω τήν καλοκαγα-
ϋιαν τάνδρὸς ἐκ τὴς τῶν διαβαλόντων κακίας.

CIIAPTER V111.

§ 1. cum donis] the account here following seems to be an entirely
different one from that of Arrian cited on 7 ξ ¹4 above.

vestis] ‘1·ai1nent'‚ clothing material; that is, eloth. See 10§ 25,
Vin-gil Aen lx 26 dives pz'clai vestis ct auri.

ferri candidi] probably stecl is meant. For the famous Indian steel

see Colonel Yule’s learned and interesting note on Marco Polo bk1
c 17·

ξ 2. domitum] Strabo XV 1 ἐξ 37, 69 speaks of tame lions in India.
and Marco Polo bk 11 c 16 tells of a talne lion taught to lie down before
the great Kaan, and in bk 11 c 18 of tamed lions (tigers) leopards and
wolves used sor hunting purposes like dogs by the Great Kaan. See
Colonel Y ule on the passage.

lacertarum] probably the hides of crocodiles are meant. Aelian
hist anim XVI 6 speaks of an animal which M‘Crindle p 163 makes out
to be the scaly ant-enter.

dorsa] 8the backs, that is shells, of tortoises. See Aelian hist anim
ΧΠ 14, 1 .

ἓ 3. Cratero] Arrian Vl 15 ἕ 4 says that he took Craterus and his
sogce over to the left bank of the ludus, and sent him along that
st e.

lllallorum] Curtius, it is to be remembered‚ has made the affair
related in chapter 5 take place among the Sudrakae. See above on
4 ἓ ²4· We see here that 118 conceived the Malli to have lived further
down the river, whereas Arrian puts the Malli above aud the Oxydrakae
(Sudrakae) below.

§4. Sabarcas] Diodorus xvrl 102 says κατῆρεν εἰς τὴν χώοαν τῶν
ὀνομαζομένων Σαμβαστών, and the same may be meant by Arrian vl 15
ς’ 1 τὸ τών Ἀβαστανων ἔθνος αὐτόνομον.

populi imperio] in Arrian we find frequent mention of independent
tribes. See v 20 ἓ 6, 22 ξ 1, 24§ S, vt 14§ 2 etc. So also in his
Indica 11 §9‚ 12 ἐξ 5, 6. Diodorus 11 3⁸, 39, 41 mentions states
governed democratically, and Plutarch Alex 59 speaks of τοὺς ἐλευθέρους
δήμους. Diodorus here says of the Sambastae οἰκοῦντες δέ τὰς πόλεις
δημοκρατουμένας. For these independent communities observed by the
Greeks in India see Elphinstone appendix 111 1) 261.

1 LX milia etc] these numbers are the same as those given by Dio·
< orus.
