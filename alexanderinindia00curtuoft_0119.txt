corresponds to this name. The principle of giving to the reigning
prince a name indicative .of his seat of government is known to have
existed in India. So in lx 8 § S Curtius calls the people Musicani,
while Ari-ian and Diodorus call their king Μουσικανός. See Strabo xv

ὀ μὲν Ὀρώδης ό δὲ Φραάτης ὀ δ’ ἄλλο τι. Porus is probably another name
of the same kind. See appendix Ι). We hear os another Porus con-
temporary with the more famous one here mentioned, Arriam ν 20 ᾗ 6,
21 ἐξ 2, 3, 5, Strabo XV 1 §30‚ and there seems to have 'been one
contemporary with the emperor Augustus, Strabo ἓ 73. It is to Ι>ο
noted that Curtius in 13 ἕ 5 gives this Omphis his new and official title
of Taxiles. For a name passing down with an office, but with no local
connexion, see Surena in Tacitus ann VI 42 with Orelli's note. Curtius
probably misunderstood the signifieance of the transmission, as Dio-
dorus seems also to have done.

ξ 16. PcJ-ssz-‹ze wslc's] whether this vestis be something of the nature
oftapestry‚ as 1·ug3, shawls etc, or ‘ changes of raiment ³ is not easy to
say. The splendour of Oriental (lrapery was proverbial. See Proper-
tius ΙΙΙ 18 19. In lx 3 ξ 10 it is merely a rhetorical expression for a
foreign dress.

§ 17. sicat...2·ta] this is one of the Latin equivalents sor the Greek
μὲν...δέ, and should be rendered by simply putting ‘while’ with the
former of the two verbs. Compare 111 12 ξ 16 of Hephaestion ct sicut
zzstatepar erat regi im corporis slahim praestabat.

Ἴ οὐςίνίηχξναί] perhaps the soree of this plupersect is ‘bound him sor
