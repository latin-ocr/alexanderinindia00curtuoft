of Coenus. The one dissicultyin the way of this explanation is the
presence, according to Arrian ¹5 ξ 7, of the war-chariots in front of the
Indian horse. But it seems easier to suppose that Coenus was able to
elude these clu1nsy adversaries than that Alexander expected him to see
froin the Macedonian lest the right moment sor his own charge and then
whecl round the rear os the whole Indian ariny and execute his orders
opportunely. Diodorus xvxi 88 says ’γενομένης ὃέμάχης τὸ μὲν πρῶτον τοῖς
ἱππεῦσιν ἅπαντα σχεδὸν τὰ ἅρματα τῶν Ἰνδῶν διεφθάρη. If this restem, as
Ι think it does. to the beginning of the main battle, the chief objection
is removed. [1 am solely responsible sor this note, which will I think
explain the passage of Curtius by that of Arrian. W. E. Heitland.]

Leonnatc] Arrian mentions Seleucus here and leaves out Leonnatus.
The three were in command os the phalanx of soot.

§ 16. lmslae] the Macedonian σάρισα was over 20 seet long. Sec
lx '7§ 19. Livy lx 1()§ 7, xxxvii 42 ἓ 4, Polybius XVIII 29, Lucan x
47, 48, 'l'hirlwall c 48 (vol Π p 147). They seem to have been some-
what like the long pikes of the Scotch Borderers described by Scott.

ancfps] ‘uncertain’; that is, not to be depended on, as being likely
to damage their own side as much as (is not more than) the enemy.

§ 17. laevum comm] that is, the cavalry on the Indian left.

ἓ 18. uno impetu] Arrian v 17 ξ 3 tells us that the phalanx at first
suffered greatly from the charges of the elephants. So Diodorus XVII
58.

qua...2‘nssz'l] Arrian says καὶ ἐν τούτῳ οἱ ἐπιστάται τῶν ἐλεφάντων
ἀντεπῆγον τῇ ἵππῳ τὰ, θηρία, καὶ ὴ φάλαγξ αὐτή τῶν Μακεδόνων ἀντεπῄει
πρὸς τοὺς ἐλέφαντας.

ἓ 19. stalacrenl] ‘rested'. For the matter see on 9 ξ 28, and com-
pare what Xenophon says of the Karduchi in anab 1'v 2 ἓ 28 ἄριστοι δέ
καὶ τοξᾶται ἦσαν (οἱ Καρδοῦχοι)· εἶχον δὲ τόξα ἐγγὺς τριπήχη, τὰ δὲ τοξεύ-
ματα πλέον ἢ διπήχη· εἷλκον δὲ τὰς νευρὰς ὁπότε τοξεύοιεν πρὶς ·τὸ κάτω
τοῦ τόξου τῷ ἀριστερῷ ποδὶ προσβαίνοντες. τά δὲ τοξεύματα ἐχώρει διὰ
τῶν ἀσπίδων καὶ διὰ τῶν θωράκων. Schneider thinks that crossbows are
there meant, but this view is probably wrong.

inponunt] put on the string.

lubrica] from the rain of the night before. But Arrian V 15 ἓ 5 says
that Porus drew up bis army on sandy ground, which the rain no doubt
would make firm3 in fact he calls it ἄπεδον καὶ στερεόν.

id] the slipperiness of the ground.

molientes] preparing, striving to deliver. Compare IX 10 ἓ ῐ9,
Vix-gil georg 1 329, IV 331.

occupantur] see on 9 ἓ 32, and add Ovid sasti 1 575 occupat Alcides
(Cacum). See also below xx 1 § 32, 7 ξ 22.

ἓ 20. turbatis] ταραχῆς δὲ πολλῆς γενομένης, says Diodorus.

ἓ 21. in medium] compare IX 1 § 21, Virgil Aen XI 335 consume
, in medium et rebus succurrite fissis.

ς· 22. obv.'us...iubet] Diodorus also mentions an essort of Porus to
