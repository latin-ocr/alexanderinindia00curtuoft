“lt ts dffcult to commend loo hzgrlzly this excellent series.—Guardian.

“The modesty of the general title qf this series has, we believe, led
many lo misunderslancl its character and undcrrate its value. T he books
are well suited sor study in the upper forms of our best schools, bul not
the less are they adapled to the wants of all Bible sludents who arc not
specialists. We doubt, indeed, whether any of the numerous popular
commmtarz'es recently issued in tlzz's country will be found more scr-
vz'ceablesor general use.''——Academy.
