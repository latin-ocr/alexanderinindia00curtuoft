108 Q. CURTJRUFJHJSJ: ALEX. [vm 10 g 29—36

αςςννι] ‘weak’, the set epithet ot mortales in Virgil and Lucretius, a
rendering of the Homeric δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι, meant to contrast man's
weakness with divine strength. See Conington on Virgil georg 1 237.

vitia] the physical flaws or desects from which the divine nature is
prcsumcd to be srce.

ἓ 30. aule quam perspexit] antequam and other like particles are
put with the perfect, not with the plupersect, of the indicative mood.
See Madvig ἓ 338 b obs 5.

moliebantur] we have kept the old reading, which the MSS support.

For molirizto destroy‚ ‘pull down’ compare vu 5 ἓ 33 tamlcm, ut
deicerent, fundamenta murorum ab imo moliuntur, ne quod urbis vesli-
gium extat-ct, Tacitus ann 139, hist 11 22, Livy lx 3, xxv 36. For
the matter see IV 2 ἓ 18 of the mole made at the siege of Tyre magua
vis saxorum ad manum emt [γι-ο velere prm‘lmnle: mam-iss ex Libano
monte ratibus ct turribusfiniendis advehebatur. See on lx 5 ἓ 19.

sacz'cndo aggeri] sor the construction see Madvig ξ 415.

cum ramis] ‘boughs and all’. See 11 ἓ 8.

moles saxorum] ‘masses of rocks' that is, ‘great solid boulders'.
Compare corporum moles in 13 § 10, lx 2 ἓ 21.

§gn finagium] the highest point, top of a slope. Compare Cic
(le off 111 ξ 33 scd qnoniam operi inchoato prope lamen absoluto tamqnam
fizstiglum imponimus and Holden’s note, also Mayor on Cic philippic
11 ἓ 110.

machinas] Arrian IV 26§ 5.

§ 3²- rudes taliam operum] ‘unskilled in such worlcs'. Compare
tx 8§ 14. See Elphinstone (abstract of Menu in bk 1 e 2 p 26) ‘In
another place 100 bowmen in a sort are said to be a match sor 10,ooo

cnemies; so sar was the art of attack behind that os desence: a siege
therefore is out cs the question'.

terrebant] according to Arrian the besieged were not tern‘fied by the
works, but lost heart when their leader was killed by a bolt (βέλει dmi
μηχανῆς). 'l'his may explain the conduct of the regina mentioned by

Curtius.
adiutas] the MSS give auditas, some having also the marginal cor-
rection adiutas, which Vogel adopts; rightly, it seems.
negabant...mortalibus] this is quite in Curtius' rhetorical manner,
and need not be treated as bearing any direct relation to fact.

ξ 33. inde] ab arce.

paschal] we have accepted this conjecture of Eberhard, as placebat
(the old reading) seems capable os no sati<saetory explanation. In ἓ 10
above it suits well enough. For patebat compare ι ι ξ 7.

ξ 34. pateris] compare Virgil georg 11 192 qualem palm-is libamus et
auro.

ξ 35. quippe ...... est] ‘in fact he addressed her as “queen ''.’ ap-
pellala cst implies ab Alexandro in the same way as inpetravil above

does.
