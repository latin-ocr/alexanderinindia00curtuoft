90 Q. CURTI RUFI JJJSJT ALEX. [V1119

§8. Acesines] now the Chenah. For this river and its affluents
Hydaspes (Jhelam) Hydraotes (Ravi) and Hyphasis (Sam-j), the waters
of which it carries to the Indus, see Arrian Vl 14 ξ 5. 'l'he Hyphasis
(or Hypasis, Vipasa) seems properly to mean the Bias river, but to
have been applied to the stream formed hy thejunction of that river
with the Satlej. See however note 1 on 9² 7 os introduction B.

Iomanen] a elever conjectural insertion, due to Hedicke. Foss had
suspected some such omission, as the old attempt to make the Acesines
run into the Ganges hy finding some other modern name sor it was
prepostermm. For the junction os the Jamna and Ganges see Pliny
N H Vl ἓ 63 ad constucnlcm Iomanis amnis et Gangis, ἓ 69 amnis
Iomanes in Gangen per Palibothros decurrit.

quippe] this word is especially frequent in Curtius in the s se of
‘the fact is', ‘in truth’. C01npare§19,10§35, 11 ἕ 19, 13§ ‚lx ’,-
ἐξ 2, 23 and elsewhere. See introduction A ἕ 3.

os] used generally os the mouth of a river, here of the mouth or sace
that one river presents to another at their junction. Render ‘in truth
the Ganges presents a rough sace to its entrance, and its waters though
beaten back (in eddies) do not give way '.

mpercussac] see on 13 ἓ 9.

§9. Dyardenes] cannot be identified. It is however worth com-
paring the report given in Strabo xv 1 ξ 72 os Arteinidorus‘ account of
the Ganges, where an obscure river-name occurs, with a description
very like that of the Dyardenes; τῶν δὲ συρρεόντων εἰς αὐτὸν Οἰδάνην
τινὰ, καλεῖ· τρέφειν δὲ καὶ κροκοδείλους καὶ δελφῖνας· λέγει δὲ καὶ ἄλλα.
τινά, συγκεχυμένως δὲ καὶ ἀρ’γῶς, ὧν οὑ φροντιστέον. This passage has
been noticed by Miitzell.

uli Nilus] Alexander on seeing crocodiles in the Indus jumped to
the conclusion that he had found the source of the Nile. ,See Arrian
Vt 1 ἕξ 2, 3, Herod IV 44 (quoted on ξ 4), Strabo xv 1 ξ ²5 (of the
Hydaspes), Arrian Indica 6 ἓ 8 (of Indian rivers in general).

delphinos] this, as Zumpt remarks, is the proper Latin form of the
accusative plural, and should be kept in prose.

ἓ 10. Etlzz'mantns] this spelling has been kept, as nearer to the
MSS. Miitzell has shewn that Ritter was wrong in identisying this
with the Etyniandrus of Arrian lv 6 ἓ 6.

subinde] ‘now and then’‚ ‘often’. The regular silver-age use of
the word. Compare 13 ἓ 18, lx 3 ἓ 24, 4 ξ 9, 5 Β· 7.

m'gantibns] Strabo xv 1 ἓ 50 speaks of a board charged with the
supervision os irrigation works, but this is srom Megasthenes, and refers
to the Ganges.

carpitur] is spent, used up. Compare Virgil georg 111 215 carpit
enim vires paulatim, Aen 1v 2 caeco carpitur z'gyzi, 32 solane perparca
maerens carpere iuventa. The word is used in military history of cutting
ofl stragglers and detachments (carpere agmen), or of dividing an army
into portions. See Livy vl 3²· xxu 32, xxvn 46, xxm 38.

ea causa] ‘that is the reason’. The pronoun as usual is attracted to
