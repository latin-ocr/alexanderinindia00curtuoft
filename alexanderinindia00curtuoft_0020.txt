the story——by the matter even more than the manner. And if
the conditions of school teaching are now so far changed that
these claims would in themselves hardly suffice to restore Curtius
to favour, we have now a further one to urge—that it is desirable
that the habit of reading critically‚ without light unreasoning
belief, should be acquired early, and that Curtius is eminently
