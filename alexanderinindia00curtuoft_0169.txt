§g 16—25] NOTES. 165

tells us that those present likened the scene to a conssict between Ares
(Koragus) and Herakles (Dioxippus).

ἓ 21. interfici posse] that is, cum.

vitasset] IV 6 ἓ 16 &rigua emporis declinatione evitato ictu, Virgil
Aen V 444—5 ille ictum wnimtcm a vertice velox praevidit celerique
clapsus corpore cessit. Diodorus here says βραχὺ παρεγκλίνας τὴν ἐπιφε·
ρομένην πληγὴν ἐξένευσεν.

antequam..dextram] Diodorus makes him advance with levelled
sarisa.

ἓ 22. Ossllpclltlnl conplexu] grappled him before he was ready.
Diodorus says μέλλοντος δ’ αὐτοῦ σπᾶσθαι τὴν μάχαιραν, ἔφθασε προπη-
δήσας, καὶ τῇ μὲν εὐωνύμῳ κατέλαβε τὴν ἕλκουσαν τὸ ξίφος χεῖρα, τῇ δ’
άλλη κινήσας ἐκ τῆς βάσεως τὸν ἀντίπαλον ὑπέσυρε τὰ σκέλη.

[tristavit] knocked (here, knocked down) like a battering ram. For
the word compare Plautus truc 11 ii 1 quis illic cst qui tam proterve
nostras aedes arietat? virgil Aen XI 890.

z'accntc] the general dative of relation, closely related to the dativus
commodi et incommodi. Compare virgil Aen Ix 347 —8 pectore z'n
adverso totum cni comminus ensem condidit adsmjgenti.

clisurns] meaning to brain him. Compare Plaut Poen ΙΙ 46 iam
elidam caput nisi auscultas. Diodorus says that having got his enemy
down he looked up to the spectator5‚ who cheered and made a great
noise, but adds nothing as to the intenlions of the conqueror. Curtius
is probably striving to make the most of his story by little effective
touches.

ξ 23. tristis etc] Diodorus XVII 101 says ό μὲν βασιλεὺς προσέταξεν
ἀφεῖναι, καὶ τὴν θέαν διαλύσας ἀπηλλάγη δυσφορῶν ἐπὶ τῇ τοῦ Μακεδόνος
ηττῃ.

verebatur] the use of this word in the sense of seeing with grief and
vexation, taking an accusative and infinitive aster it, is rare. Compare
Ovid heroid XVI 7 5, 76 vincere crant omncs dignae, iudexque verebar
mm omncs causam vincere posse suam. See Madvig ἓ 376 obs.

ἓ ²4· ex conposito] by private arrangement. The expression is
common.

subdar-itur] Diodorus says that they took the cup, and hid it

beneath Dioxippus⁷ pillow, then charged him with thest‚ and made pre-
tence to find it there.

ἓ 25. constantiae] ‘firmness'‚ here applied to the power of sitting
unmoved under an imputation. So Nepos Ait 22 ἓ 1 says of the words
of the dying Atticus lmc oratione habita tauta constantia vocis atque
voltus, that is, without faltering in speech or moving a muscle of his
sace. ‘Constancy’ in this sense is common in Shakespeare.

rubore] abstract sor concrete. The sense is ‘ osten those who blush
at a salse insinuation are less able to bear the glauce of reproach than
those who are really guilty '.
