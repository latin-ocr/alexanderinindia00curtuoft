appointincnts, and such other public business as is most os a pcrsonal
nature. He is now also to give some time to relaxation3 and then to
review his troops, perform his religious duties at sunset, and afterwards
to receive the reports of his emissaries. At length he withdraws to his
most private apartments to supper; and, aster indulging sor some time
in music, is to retire to rest '.

ἓ 26. auro caelata] in gold-raised work, embossed in gold. Com-
pare Virgil Aen 1 640, 641 lngus argentmn mensis, caelataque in auro
Jbrliasacm patrum. Also the Trojan doorways Aen 11 504 (llzalamz)
barbariw postes auro spoliisque superbi, where to treat auro spolc'tquue as
a hendiadys is weak.

ἕ 27. cmn....j³cclz't alque ornat] ‘even when he is combing antl
dressing his hair'. 'l'hrough this sense ‘even when' coines that of
‘though ’. Compare Caesar bell Gall ΙΙ 27 at hostes eliam in extrema
spe salutis tantam virtutem praestiterunt ut, qu n m prim ι’ eoru nt ceci-
dissent, ptvximz' iacmlilnts insisterent alque ex corum corporibus pugna-
7·cnt; where cecidissent is subjunctive because past tense and in de-
pendent clause. It will too be interesting to turn to Cic de Off 111
ἓ 74 where cum potcstz‘ having the power ’, and compare the parallel
sipossunt and sipolest in 1 ξ 23, the place referred to.

capillum] Strabo xv 1 ξ 55, though he does not mention the hair-
drcssing in particular, well illustrates the general sense of this passage ;
τῶν δὲ μὴ κατὰ πόλεμον ἐξόδων μία μέν ἐστιν ἦ ἐπὶ τάς κρίσεις, ἐν αἶς διη-
μερεύει διακούων οὐδὲν ἦττον κᾶνώρα ’γένηται τῆς τοῦ σώματος θεραπείας·
αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶν ἡ διὰ τῶν σκυταλίδων τρῖψις· ἅμα ’γὰρ καὶ διακούει καί τρίβεται
τεττάρων περιστάντων τριβέων.

legationibus] so in Elphinstone bk 1 c 2 (abstract of Menu) the king
is supposed throughout to give personal attention to foreign affairs,
though he employs ministers.

iura reddit] gives legal decisions=administers justice, hearing cases.
Compare Livy VII Ι ξ 6 where fractorem z'nrn reddenlem is to be explained
by Vl 42 ξ 1 1 qni ius in urbe diceret, Tacitus ann X111 51 ima adversus
publicanos extra ordinem redderent, VI 11 qni ins redderet. Curtius V 7
ξ 8 speaking of the burning of Persepolis has the corresponding phrase3
hunc exilum lmbnit regia totius orientis, unde lat gentes antea iura pefe-
bant. For the matter see Elphinstone bk 1 c 3 (abstraet of Menu)
‘Justice is to be administered by the king in person, assisted by Bramins
and other counsellors ’, and the note there on p 27. From Strabo XV 1
ἐξ 34, 49, 53, 54, Diodorus 11 4² we gather that the Indians appeared
to the Greeks a people averse to litigation, that the king and his
assessors were severe and discouraged litigation, and that the cases
brought for judgment were chiefly of a criminal nature, such as murder
and personal violence. See Elphinstone appendix 111 On tlte Grccl:
accounts of India.

odoribus inlinuntur] no doubt aster washing.

§28 venatus] Megasthenes is perhaps the only authority sor this
statement, as he seems to be for that in Strabo xv 1 ἓ 55 τρίτη δ’ (ἔξοδος)
ἐπὶ θήραν βακχική τις κύκλῳ ’γυναικῶν περικεχυμένων, ἔξωθεν δὲ τῶν δορυ-
