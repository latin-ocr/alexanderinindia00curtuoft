¹²4 Q. CURTJ RUFI HISII ALEX. [vm 14

retrieve the fortune os the ‹lay hya general attack with his 40 remaining
elephants, which succecdcd at lirst. Perhaps this may be another
version os the light described in Arrian v ¹7§3. See below on ἐξ 25. 26.

§2 3. parridum] Compare Tacitus hist. Η 68 (Vitellius) ad omnes
suspitioncs pavidus.

adomnia] so we say ‘to shy at everything’. The eleph-ants were
well known to cause great terror in horses.

§24. concursatione] ‘running about ', hence ‘skirmishing’ of light
troops. Miitzell compares Livy xxx 34 of the Carthaginian troops,
concursalio cl velocitas illinc maior quam vis.

§.²²5- izrccntem...eos] Arrian v ¹7 ξς (continued from quotation
above on ἓ ι8) ἕς τε τοὺς ἐπιβάτας αὐτῶν ἀκοντίζοντες καὶ αὐτὰ τα θηρία
περισταδὸν παντόθεν βάλλοντες.

constanter] ‘firinly’‚ ‘steadily’. Not as the light troops who would
advance or retire as the Indians retired or advanced.

ξ 26. obtriti etc] Arrian V 17 ἓ 3 ‘sor the beasts charged the ranks
of the soot, and wherever they turned were crushing through the Mace-
‹lonian phalanx though in close formation'. Diodorus gives a vivid
description os the havoc wrought by the elephants in the early part of
the battle.

suere documentum] the nominative is less common in the best writers.
See Madvig ἓ 249 note a. We have however ξι 4ῐ esset exemplum, and
there are many instances in other writers, but none of these seem to
have the following construction with ut.

§27- fizcies] Compare the passage quoted on 11 ἓ 12, also lx 7
ἓ ιο, 8 ἓ 5. Tacitus Agr 36, hist 11 89.

mann] ‘trunk'. See Cic cie divin 11 § 122. Lucretius 11 537,
v 1303.

ἓ 28. in mullum diei] Madvig ξ 285 b obs 1.

ἓ 29. copz'das] ehoppers, something like a Goorka knise. κοπὶς
srom same root as κόπτω.

timor] this, remarks Zumpt. must be the sear in which the Mace-
donian soldicrs stood ot* the elephants. This sear stimulated their inge-
nuity and ferocity‚ so that the elephants that sell in the battle were

disgquiilwith a spiteful barbarity worth special notice. novi=unheard
ο , orr1 e.

omittebat] for the sense generally compare Tacitus Agr. 16 ncc ullum
in barbaris sawiliae genus omisit ira ct victoria.

ξ 30. eqeo...oblcrebamnr] Diodorus XVII 88 μετᾰ. δὲ ταῦτα nso
θηρίων συνακοντιζομένων καὶ διὸ. τὸ πλῆθος τῶν τραυμάτων περιωδύνων
-γινομένων, ol μὲν περιβεβηκότες αὐτοῖς Ἰνδοὶ κρατεῖν τῆς ὁρμῆς τῶν ζῴων
οὐκ ἴσχυον· ἑκνεύοντα ’γὰρ εἰς τοὺς ἰδίους ταῖς ὁρμαῖς ἀκατασχέτως ἐφέρετο
καὶ τοὺς φίλους avrea-drea, Arrian V 17 ἓξ 5, 6. ’

ab ipsis] that is, quos rexerant, ‘by the very beasts they had driven'
.-=' hv their own beasts'. The words go in the first instance with pmc-
cipuali.
