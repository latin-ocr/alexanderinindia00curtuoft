probable that Curtius has not mistaken his authorities but followed

agrestium, a non—fructiferous sort of palm.

ιξἰζςηὶίιιν] that is ibi, in ca regione.
ἓ 12. iumenta etc] so Arrian vl 25 ἓ r, who however (cc 24—26)

places the scene of these terrible sufferings in the land of the Γαδρωσοὶ
proper, which is the inore probable account. See on ἓ 18 quiete.

cremabant inccndio] ‘ set fire to and burnt’‚ as we say.

ἓ 13. pestilentia] Arrian vt '²5 ἓξ 2, 3 speaks of their suffering from
a νόσος, but does not attach such importance to it as Curtius seems to

ad lzoc] on the top of this, ⁸ besides’.

ἓ 14. strati etc] Arrian substantially agrees with all this, and likens
those who lay down in the sandy desert to men lost at sea.

agmen etc] Arrian says σπουδῇ ’γάρ πολλῇ ἐγίγνετο ὁ στόλος, καὶ ἐν τῷ

ipsis] themselves, that is the persons addressed, those hurrying on.

ἓ 17. quia...esset] because (as he felt) he was, ‘feeling himself to be’.
This subjunctive of the assumed reason is common enough. See Mad-
vig § 357 a. Arrian VI ²4 ἐξ 2, 3 tells us that Alexander well knew
what he had to expect when he undertook this march; but the legends
of the journeys of Semiramis and Cyrus through the same district, how
