Q 14—25] NOTES. 131

recipiunt] admit, ‘welcome'. The force of the word is ‘take in as
due’, because they had sor some time made up their own minds to do
so. Compare rcctpt't in vul 9 ἓ 32.

§23. convocaverunt] called them to a conference. The con has
the force of ‘to', ‘to meet'.

vim] Eichert in his lexicon takes this as ‘strength'‚ that is, as eqni-
valent to vires. But perhaps it may more strictly mean ‘violence',
‘severity’. Arrian V 24 ἓ 6 says that Eumenes was to tell the people
of some hostile towns ‘that they would have no harsh treatment from
Alexander if they remained and received him as a friend; for neither
had any of the other independent Indians who surrendered themselves
willingly’. So here we may have just the reverse meant, speaking of
those who resisted. But see below ξ 3²·

infidam accepit] took under his protection. *Compare 7 ἓ 14.

ἓ ²4· regnam Sopz'llzr's] According to Arrian vl 2 ξ 2 the kingdom
of Sopithes lay on the lest bank of the Hydaspes, Strabo xv 1 ς 30
also says that some place it between that river and the Acesines, bnt
adds that others put it beyond the Acesines and Hyaroffis, ‹whieh view
is evidently that followed by Curtius (see ἓ 35) and Diodorus XVII 91.
See M‘Crindle p 154, who points out that Lassen has identified the
name Sopithes with Sanskrit Asz'apalc' ‘ lord of horses’. According to
strabo Sopithes was king of the Kathaei.

ut barbari credunt] ‘ in the opinion of the natives’.

sapientia] see on VIII ¹3 ξ 7.

banis moribus] so Diodorus XXII 91 μετὰ. δὲ ταῦτ’ ἐστράτευσεν ἐπὶ
τὰς ὑπὸ Σωπείθην τεταγμένας πόλεις, εὐνομουμένας καθ’ ὑπερβολήν.

regitur] is ruled or directed by. Hence: ‘lives under' as in 8 ἓ 4.

ξας). genitos etc] Diodorus says τὸ κάλλος παρ’ αὐτοῖς τιμιώτατον
νενόμισται. διόπερ ἐκ νηπίου παρ’ αὐτοῖς τὰ βρέφη διακρίνεται, καὶ τὰ μὲν
ἄρτια καὶ τὴν φύσιν ἔχοντα πρὸς εὐπρέπειαν καὶ ἰσχὺν εὔθετον τρέφεται,
τὰ δὲ καταδεῆ τοῖς σώμασιν ἀνάξια τροφῆς ἡγούμενοι διαφθείρουσιν. Strabo
XV 1 ξ 30 tells the same story, but only on the authority of Onesikritus.
For some remarks on these customs see Wheeler's History of India 111

4 (pp 24, ¹73)-

tollmzt] this word is strictly applied only to the Roman custom of
placing a newborn child on the ground at the seet of the father, who
by raising it in his arms signified that he acknowledged the child as his
own and was prepared to rear it. Here tollunt alantque is really
one notion. Perhaps we may render ⁴ acknowledge and rear’.

eornm etc] ‘the commissioners entrusted with the medical in-
spection of the babies ’. So Strabo says κριθέντα δ’ ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀποδειχθέν-
τος αρχοντος.

habitum] ‘ condition’‚ hence bodily sorm, ‘ looks’. Compare 2 ξ 6,

Ὶὲη.

inszjgnes] ‘remarkable’, hence ‘ deformed’. Compare Suetonius
Calig 26 insignes debilitare aliqua emporis.
