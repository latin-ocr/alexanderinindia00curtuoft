§g 6—14] NOTES 129

ἓ 12. lcz'c qnoque] see § 4. So Diodorus XVII 90 says εἶχε δὲ καὶ
ἡ χώρα ὄφεων πλῆθος μικρῶν μὲν τοῖς μεγέθεσι ταῖς δὲ ποικιλίαις ἐξηλλαγ·
μένων· οἱ μὲν γὰρ χαλκοειδεῖς ῥάβδους ἑπέφαινον etc.

reddentibus] ‘sending out’, ‘giving ’. The notion of ‘back srom’
soon passes into that os ⁴ out from ', and so uuidere is really :praehere
Compare 111 α ἓ 5 scutis cell-ae maxime speciem reddentibus, and see on
4 g 2 3 below.

virus etc] Diodorus says διὰ δὲ τῶν δηγμάτων ὀξεῖς θανάτους ἀπειργά-
ζοντο and so 0115 Strabo speaking of some small venomous snakes says
xv 1 ἓ 45 τοὺς δὲ πληγέντας αἱμορροεῖν ἐκ παντὸς πόρου μετὰ ἐπωδυνὶας,
ἔπειτα ἀποθνήσκειν εἰ μὴ βοηθήσει τις εὐθύς.

praesens] we have now in English dropped the correct usage of this
word, and use ‘ instant ’ or ‘immediate '. Compare 2 ἓ 19.

remedium etc] Diodorus says μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα παρὰ τῶν ἐγχωρίων μα·
θόντες τὴν ἀντιφάρμακον ρῖζαν ἀπελύθησαν τίον δεινῶν. Strabo goes on
τὴν δὲ βοήθειαν ῥᾳδίαν εἶναι διὰ τὴν ἀρετήν τῶν Ἰνδικῶν ῥιζῶν καὶ φαρμά-
κων. See also Arrian Indica 15 ς’ 11. 'she incolae are probably some
of the local Brahmans.

ἓ ¹3· iunctum] that is, on the banks of the river. The order of
the sense is erat nemus inm-[mn flumini. The last two words are an
ερίῖΙιεῑεπαραποτάμιον or some such word.

tardioribus] Strabo XV 1 ξ 21 πολλὰ γὰρ δή δένδρα παράδοξα ἦ Ἰνδικὴ
τρεφει.
' pmf‘sgum] Elphinstone intr p 10 says ‘the peacock also is common
in a wi state '.

stae-quens] ‘crowded ’‚ ‘filled ’. Compare V 4 ἓ 6 firlilc's terra mul-
nsque vicis alque urbibus frequens.

ἓ ¹4· ofpz'dum] Mtitzell refers this to the same place as that spoken
of by Arrian V 22 ξ 3 καὶ δευτεραῖος μὲν σῖπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ ’Ὑδραώτου
πρὸς πόλιν ἧκεν ᾗ ὄνομα Πίμπραμα· τὸ δ’ ἔθνος τοῦτο τῶν Ἰνδῶν Ἀδραϊσταὶ
ἐκαλοῦντο. If this be right, then Curtius must have had a very different
account of the affairs betore him, sor Arrian goes on οὖτοι μὲν δὴ προσε-
χώρηέαν ὁμολογίᾳ Ἀλεξάνδρῳ. See also Diodorus XVII 91, Arrian
21 ἓ .

corona] by a general attack all round the walls. Compare 4 ἓ 4, VII

6 ἓ 19 urbem corona circnlntz'cclil munitiorem qnam ut primo impetn capi
posset.

magnam etc] Diodorus XVII 91 says that Alexander took τήν μεγί-
στην καὶ ὀχυρωτάτην πόλιν of the Kadmeans, but whether this corresponds
to the present notice of Curtius is not certain. Strabo XV 1 ἓ 33 says
that between the Hypanis (=Hyphasis) and Hydaspes were 9 tribes
and 5000 πόλεις οὐκ ἐλάττους Κῶ τῆς Μεροπίδος, and in XIV 2 ἓ 19 he
says that Kos was ού μεγάλη. We may therefore infer that the words
of Curtius ut in ea regione are not without authority.

urbem] probably the place called by Arrian τὰ Σάγγαλα the most
important town of the Kathaeans. General Cunningham finds this at
