αὐτοῦς ἀμπέχεσθαι φορήματα. reporting the account of Klitarchus. See
also Elphinstone bk 111 c 11 pp τοι, 202 ⁴ The sull dress is a long white
gown of almost transparent muslin, close over the body, but in in-
numerable loose solds below the waist'. The writer thinks however
that some of the dress is borrowed srom the Mahometans: whether this

part or not he does not say. Pratt remarks that the Sanskrit term for
muslins or fine calicoes is kmy‘asz'.

solcis] slippers, covering little more than the sole of the soot.
Miitzell observes that Philostratus in l'hotius says that the Indians wear
ὑποδήματα βύβλου. But Arrian Indica 16 ξ 5 says on the authority of
Nearchus that ὑποδήματα δὲ λευκοῦ δέρματος φορέουσι, περισσῶς καὶταῦτα
ἠσκημένα, καὶ τὰ ἴχνεα. τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῖσι ποικίλα καὶ ι’ψηλὰ τοῦ
μέζονας φαίνεσθαι. The latter may possibly rather refer to princes and
wealthy people. See Curtius below lx 1 ξ ²9·

used for a dinner napkin (Catullus η) or the sail ofa ship.

according to Elphinstone bk 111 c 11 p 201 ‘The head and beard are
shaved‚ but a long tuft of hair is left on the crown. Mustachios are also
worn, except perhaps by strict Bramins'.

same account.
