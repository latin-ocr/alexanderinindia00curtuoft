ἐξ 5—19] NOTES. 111

ἓ 10. Alcxamk’r] Plutarch Alex 58 apparently speaking of this
same affair says ἑτέρᾳ δέ ὁμοίως ἀποτόμῳ (πέτρᾳ) προσβαλὼν τοὺς νεωτέρους
τῶν Μακεδόνων παρώρμα, καὶ Ἀλέξανδρόν τινα καλούμενον προσαγορεύσας
“ ἀλλὰ σοι’ ’γε ” εἶπεν “ ἀνδραγαθεῖν προσήκει καὶ διὰ τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν ’' ἐπεὶ
δὲ λαμπρῶς ὁ νεανίας ἀγωνιζόμενος ἔπεσεν, οὐ μετρίως ἐδήχθη.

non placuit] perhaps this may refer to some resolution of a couneil'of
war or ofa general assembly os the Macedonian troops. In VIII 1 ἓ 18
we are told that after Alexander had exposed himself to great peril in
the great hunt in Sogdiana the Macedonians quamquam prospero eveum
defunctus erat Alarandcr, lantcn scfz'cm’ gallis snae more ne ant jn‘a'ci·
venaretur ant sine delectis princtfmn alque amicorum. See Thirlwall
c 52 (vol VI pp 304, 305).

ἓ 11. vir audaciae promptae] see a like passage IX 6 ἓ 10.

corporis custodes] the Greek name sor these was σωματοφύλακες.
There seem to have been two sorts os them (i) a small picked body of
distinguished officers who formed a kind of staff attached to the king's
>ersom and (2) a larger body of Macedonian youths of high family who
i'ormed the regia cohors of bodyguards and attendants. See Arrian VI
28 ξ 4, Curtius IX 6 ὲ 4, 8 ἐ 23, 10 ἓ 26, V111 6 ἐξ 21, 22, and ἐξ 2—6.

relictisque] que as osten zmil. Compare 14 ἓ 3 5.

ξ 12. ruis-erabilis etc] sor the general sense compare VII 11 ξ 16 illa
t'ero miserabilis crat facies, quum ii qnos inffabilis ⁴gradus sifi‘llcrat ex
praecipiti ‹involvet-natzar. mox cadem ilz se pudienda alieni casus ostendebat
exemplum.

ἓ 14. superne etc] Diodorus XVII 85 ‘at first then the barbarians
being on higher ground had the advantage and killed many of those who

came rashly up to the assault '-

ἓ 15. acrius quam cautius] ‘ with more spirit than judgment '. For
the double comparative see Madvig ξ 307, Kennedy ξ 76 B 2.

ἓ 16. incesserent] so ix 5 ἓ 8.

ξ 18. intuspidz] not in a hui-ry, cool. The word is somewhat rare,
and seems not to be used by Curtius elsewhere.

depulisse contenti] compare 1 V 10 ἓ 54 illazacus, qm' aulea per osium
vicos incendant, iam fitgsre contentus ²Nsrczque inviolata hosti reliquit.
See Madvig ἓ 389 obs 3.

ς 19. statm'sset etc] Arrian and Diodorus give no account of any
such intention on the part of Alexander. The former (who is the more
worthy of our confidence) says that the Indians terrified at last by the
occupation of a cliff commanding their position, while the front attack
was pushed on with unflagging vigoun made proposals for a surrender.
This was merely a ruse in order to gain time sor a retreat under cover of
night. Alexander discovered their purpose, left open a way for them to
escape, and fell upon them in their retreat, as described below by Cur-
tius. See Thirlwall c 53 (vol VII p 10).

succedere] to take the place of, ‘ relieve ’. sub conveys the notion of
‘to the help ’. Compare subvenire, succurrere, subsiciuam. So in Greek
ὑπό, as in ὑπουργεῖν, ὑπηρέτης.
