strengthened by a marriage alliance ’. For the word adfinitatem see
Holden on Cic de off 1 ἓ 54, where a list os adfines is given.

ἓ 23. Nicaeam] General Cunningham finds the site os this at Mong
on the lest or eastern bank of the Hydaspes. It will be remarked that
Curtius speaks as though these towns were on the Acesines, yet he can-
not have meant this as lie makes the great battle (vlu 14) take place on
the Hydaspes.

Bucephala] the name is given thus by Arrian and Diodorus, though
the former makes it neuter plural, the latter feminine singular. Strabo
and Plutarch call it Βουκεφαλια. General Cunningham finds the site of
this place at Jalalpur on the right or western bank of the Hydaspes.

34·

memoriae ac nomint] a hendiadys, ‘to commemorate’.

dedicans] ‘dedicating’ in the metaphorical sense in which the silver-
age writers use the word. Compare Pliny NH praef ἓ 12 meae quidem
ἕὶἕιὶἕὲἷαίί accessit lzoc quoque, quod levioris operae ltos tibi dedicavi

§ ²4· elephanti& etc] this account is neither clear nor correct. We
know from Arrian VI 2 ξ 2 that the bulk os the army marched along the
banks of the river, Craterus commanding the division on the right
bank, Hephaestion the larger one on the lest bank: the elephants were
with the latter. With this Diodorus xvli 96 agrees in general terms.

secundo amne] ‘down stream', as we say. Compare 6 ἓ 2, 8 ἓ 3,
9 ἓ 27, Virgil georg 111 447 missusque secundo defluit amni.

quadraginta stadia] that is, about 5 miles. Alexander did not
hurry sor the reason here given, that he might take every good oppor-
tunity os landing. This was not only sor the benefit of the armament‚
but (as we learn from Arrian VI 4 ἓ 2) to receive or compel the submis-
sion of the native tribes along the river. Strabo xv 1 ἓ 17 following
Aristobulus tells us that the voyage down to Patala at the head of the
Indus delta took ten months.

expone] disembarked, put ashore. See 9 ἓ 11.
subinde] ⁶ from time to time‘.

CHAPTER IV.

ἓ 1. committitur] ‘joins'‚ ‘ falls into’. The words seem to imply
that the Hydaspes was an affluent of the Acesines, and not vice versa,
which we know srom Arrian VI 1 ἓ 5. lt is to be remembered that
Curtius supposes the fleet to have been built and the voyage begun on
the Acesines. Compare V11 3 ἐ 20 Taurus secundae magnitudinis
mons committitur Caucaso. See below ἓ 8.

ς 2. Siborum] Diodorus also calls them Σίβαι, but Arrian and
Strabo have the form Σίβαι. It is generally supposed that a tribe
devoted to the worship of Siva are meant. See M‘Crindlc p ιιι and

v11114§11.
