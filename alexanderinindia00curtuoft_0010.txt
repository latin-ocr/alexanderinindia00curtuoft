illustrative character, as the nature of the subject
required.

In the spelling of Indian names we have generally
followed the best nmdcrn authorities; but in citing
authorities we have used the spelling adopted by the
several writers. Thus we write Brakman, but in
citing Elphinstone Bramin, and so forth.

A copious index will make up sor sorne defi-
ciencies in cross reference, and appendix D will help
in understanding the plan of Alexander's Indian
expedition generally.

The notes on the first chapter are the work of
Mr Heitland: the rest are all written in common.
Mr Raven has supplied the index and list of names
Mr Heitland the introductions and appendices.

XVhen quotations srom Greek writers seemed not
to require to be left in the original for some good
cause, we have generally given an English translation
or abstract. ΜΓ Heitland is responsible for the text,
which is based on that of Hedicke; also for the maps,
which depend mainly on General Cunningham's
Ancient Geograplzy of India.

Elphinstone's History of India has been cited
from the fifth (Cowell's) edition, and Thirlwall's
History of Grcece from the first edition in Lardner's
Cabinet Cyclopaedia. Perhaps the most specially
useful book to us has been Otto Eichert's lexicon to

Curtius (Hanover 1870). The help got from other
books is acknowledged on occasion in the notes.
