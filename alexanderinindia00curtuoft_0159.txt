Σωτῆρα ἐπικληθῆναι τὸν Πτολεμαῖον· καίτοι αὐτὸς Πτολεμαῖος ἀναγέγρα-
φεν οὐδὲ παραγενέσθαι τούτῳ τῷ ἔμ’γῳ· ἀλλὰ στρατιᾶς ’γάρ αὐτὸς ἡγούμε-
μενος ἄλλας μάχεσθαι μάχας καὶ πρὸς ἄλλους βαρβάρους, where Sintenis
refers to Pausanias 1 8 ἓ 6.

regnavit] ‘became a king’‚ ἐβασίλευσε. He founded the great
dynasty of the Egyptian Ptolcniies.

auctorest] Timagenes is regarded as a mere echo of ClitarchuS‚ so
that the singular verb is particularly appropriate. Compare Cic 11 in
Verrem 11131 5 4² dixit lwc apud vos Zosippus et Ismenias. See Madvig
ξ 213 a o s.

scilicet] ‘one may be sure', ‘of course'. There is no strong irony
consveyed by this word here, and the original form scire licet explains
its orce best.

refragatus] the word is used in its proper sense of ‘gainsay’. So
Cic pro Mur ς’ 46 tota illa lex... petitioni nstv-grata cst, Livy XLV 40.

monumenta] ‘ recortls’. Frequently of bools, as in Livy praes§ 10,
Tacitus Agr 2. rcrum=‘events'. 'she whole expression then=the
old books of history.

securitas] ‘ carelessness '.

ἐπὶ. abscidunt ita ne moveretur] such is the order of the sense
‘ They cut off the wood taking care not to stit the point’. For ita ne
(:ita ut nc) seeMadvig ἓ 456 obs 4.

media] Arrian says Vl 11 ἓ 1 that either Kritodemus a doctor or

Percligcas—for accounts disfered—drew out the dart after enlarging the
woun .

For inesse compare Ovid fasti lv 6 58 nec digitis anulus ullus inest.

ἓ ²4· occuparet] be too quick sor them, and so prevent their stanch-
ing it in time.
verebantur ne] Madvig ξ 376, Kennedy ‘s' 200.

ingens] Plutarch Alex 6 3 says of this arrow-head ‘it is said to have
been 3 fingers' breadth broad and 4 long'. Here ingens is in a way
part of the predicate, ‘the dart that had been driven home was a large
one' or better ‘ was a large one and had been driven home'. For
asaclum compare virgil Aen lx 4 3 1, 4 32 scd viribus ensis adactus traus-
amit costas et candida pectora rumpit.

viscera] probably the right lung is meant.

ξ 25. Critobulus] Pliny speaks of a doctor of this name NH VII
