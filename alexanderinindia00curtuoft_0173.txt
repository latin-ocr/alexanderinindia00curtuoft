tioned in note on vni 1 1 §s 1 1.

pacis arlt'lms] ‘civil pursuits ’‚ meaning probably statesmanship'and
‹liplomacy. Compare Tacitus hist Ι 8 Cluvius li’zfits, vir facundus et

modicus, sermone fizcz'lz's.

Tacitus hist IV 83. The following story is told by Cicero (just referred

ἓ 28. Palalz'am] this adjective seems to be formed from Patala.

Patale Patala (nom sing. it seems) and Patalene, Arrian in his Indica
of Πάτταλα, and Diodorus has the apparently corrupt form Ταύαλα. It
seems that Patala denotes the city. The place is now occupied by
Haidarabzid, the old name of which was Nirankot, also Hilalpm‘, and is
called Patasila by the Chinese traveller Hwen Thsang in the 7t11 centiuy
AD. Cunningham pp 279—287.
