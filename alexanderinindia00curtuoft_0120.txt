CHAPTER XIII.

§ 1.Al1rva] Arrian V 8} 3 ἤκον δὲ ἐνταῦθα παρ’ αὑτὸν καὶ παρὰ
Ἀβισάρου πμ έσβεις τοῦ τῶν ὀρείωνδ Ἰνδων βασιλέως.

mandalum] by Abisares.
ἓ 2. stipendium] tribute. Compare rx r ξ 14, 7 ἓ 14, Livy 11 9.

suornmfim'nm] Miitzcll iu a long and learned note shews that this
order of the words is chosen so as to throw stress on suorum. Porus
was not to cross his own frontier.

occurreret] the word is chosen as being neutral, taking indifferently a
friendly or hostile sense, as praesto esset below.

regi] ‘ his sovereign ’.

alterum] the one, or more strictly ‘ the second’, as the explanatory
clause with ut shews,

praesto esset] used again but' in fiiendly sense 1x 2 ἓ 24.

ξ 3. qutppe etc] an explanatory clause, suggested by the emphatic
ada ιι sus Indos just aboxe.

ξ 4. regulo] refers to the obscure Samaxus (or Gamaxus) above.

ἓ 5. tr'ansiln] the simple ablative with prolu'bcre comes again X 3
ξ 5 quum postero die prohibiti aditu regis essent. In lx 3 ξ 5 we have
the more common construction. Arrian v 8 ἓ 4 says ἐγνωκὼς εἴργειν τοῦ
πόρου αὑτὸν ἦ περῶντι ἐπιτίθεσθαι.

ἓ 6. ultra eos] beyond, that is here ‘behind' thern. Compare 14
ξ 3ο and 111 9 ξ 5 of the Persian array at Issus lim-cani deinde Aledique
cquz'les: lzis proximi ceterarum gentium ultra eos dextra laevaque ‹lis-
posui.

ante] 9 ἓ 28.

apte] readily‚ conveniently. Compare 14§ ¹9·

§·- μ par ...... corporis] Miitzell compares Justin XII 8 v'ffnbus cor
poris et cmi'mz nmgniludtue ῥανίυίι) 2'725131115.

saptentia] ‘33isdom’ simply here. The passage quoted on 9 ξ 31
will however illustrate this one well. Alexander's Greek flatterers made
the most os Porus in order to enhance the glory ol* their patron. See ¹4

ξ 8. fluminis ma‘rm'ludo] the size of the river would depend on the
setson os the 3·.ear Arrian 3 9 ξ 4 says that uben Alexander and Porus
saced one another on the ll3daspes it was just the summer solstice. In

¹9 ἓ 3 he places the battle 33 ith Ι oru in the Athenian month Munychion.
One of these two statements must be wrong. Probabl3 the formeris,

sor he says in the same place that it was precisel3 at the time os the
solstice that the ri3ers 33 ould be at their highest both on account os the

melting of mountain· -sn033s and of the rains (os the SW Monsoon).
Now Aristobulus' ιη Strabo xv ι ξ ¹7 while agreeing in the statement as
