the gender of the substantive instead os being made neuter. Compare

iam sine nomine] which by that time have ceased to have a name,
ἤδη ἀνώνυμα.

§ r 1. non adeo] the theory of the construction will be best explained
by Virgil Aen XI 436, 4 37 non adeo llas exosa manns Viclorizz fagit ut
lanta quicquam pro spe temptare recusem. Here if completed it would
run non adeo z'nlezfluunl ut nobilesfiant.

interfluunt] run through. Compare 111 1 ἓ 12 Gordium nomen est
urbi, quam Sangarius amnis inteastm‘t.

ξ 12. celerum] like the Greek δ’ οὖν, resuming the thread of narra-
tive aster a parenthesis or digression. Here we turn back to ἓ 3, since
which we have been dealing with rivers.

aquilone] how this mention of a hot north wind can possibly refer to
the storms and rains os the SW Monsoon [see Elphinstone introd p 5,
Meadows Taylor bk Ι c ι] is just what Zumpt and Miitzell do not
explain, though they refer it to that season. Nor will the NE Monsoon,
blowing in October and November on the Coromandel coast, answer
the description. Pratt does really try to meet the difficulty, remarking
‘As to the heat attributed to the north wind, it may be acquired by
passing over torrefied deserts in the last stages of its course’, and
quoting from Elphinstone’s Caulml p 133 “We experienced a whole
night of strong hot wind from the North-XVest '' [at Peshawer}

dem-untur] may either refer to the effect of heat or (as in Livy XL
45) to that of cold. How to explain the statement of Curtius on either
supposition is very sar from clear. The MSS read aquiloni and decur-
runt which if retained would need some other explanation than that of
Zumpt.

ita...mz'lz'a] ‘which thus (zfor this reason) are mild and nourish the
crops’. As οὑτω so ita often means ‘under such conditions’. See lx
4 ἓ 22. In this place however there is no verb and the clause is so to
speak participi-al. Compare use of idm in Plin N H 111 ἓ 78. If we had
ea aster ita we might put a colon at penem-at and understand sunt.

ἓ 13. adeo] to such an extent.

mundus] the world⁷ or universal order of things, ὀ κόσμος. See iv
1 1 ἓ 22 uec mundns duobus solibus potest regi. The exaggeration of the
differences between the climate of India and that of Europe is quite in
Curtius’ rhetorical manner. Pliny N H Π ἓ 58 is more sober and
accurate. Pratt well remarks ‘ Possibly the Macedonian-Greeks might
have encountered extreme cold in the elevated mountain tracts of India,
in the season corresponding to summer in a European climate; and
again, in descending the vallejs, of the south, have experienced oppress-
ive heat when the rigours of winter prevail in their own country; and
on these unexpected vicissitudes have founded the erroneous conclu-
sion that the times of both seasons were inverted in respect to Europe’.
