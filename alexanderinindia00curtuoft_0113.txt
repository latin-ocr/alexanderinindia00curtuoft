§36. ccxlv] at all events. quoquc. though considently rejected by
Vogel, seems to have a meaning: ‘the boy also’ (as well as the conqueror
his supposed father) bore the name Alexander.

cx ea utcumque] ‘ who anyhow was her son ², and probably Alexander's
also. A piece ot* gossip such as Curtius loves to preserve. ,

Alexandra] the attraction of the name to the case of the relative is
the common construction. See Madvig 3· 246 obs 2, Kennedy ξ 141 (8),
and com* are virgil georg 111 147, Aen 1 267. So here with the sub-
stantive pus) 0.

CIIAPTER XI.

ἓ r. Abram] this name is thought to stand sor the same place as
that called by Arrian lv ²7 3} 7-9 τά Ὦρα. But it is to be noted that
the attacking soree is there commanded by Alexander himself.

inconditos] ‘undisciplined⁷. Compare Ix 1 ξ 16, 2 ἓ 22.

secutus] Arrian IV 27 ἓ 9 εὐθύς ἐξ ἐφόδου προσβαλών τοῖς τείχεσι τῆς
πόλεως ἐκράτησε.

ἓ 2. qnorzmn...etc] Arrian 1V 28 ξ 1 ὥς δὲ καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι βάρβαροι
ἔπραττον· ἀπολιπόντες τὰς πόλεις ξύμπαντες ἔφευγον ἐς τὴν πέτραν τὴν ἐν
τῇ χώρᾳ τήν ”A ορνον καλουμένην. This Stronghold is placed by General
Cunningham at the hill where is now the ruined fortress of Ranigat.

pem-am] this word borrowed from the Greek is used by Curtius not
only osten in this book but in other parts of his history, where it is as
hard as here to see why he did not use rupes. Pliny also uses the word.
A glauce at Lucan vt 16 will shew how the word petra came to mean
‘stronghold ¹, and then became in various places a proper name. Per—
haps this may give the real reason sor Curtius' preference of the word ;
we might even render ‘stronghold '. See Thirlwall c 52 (vol VI p 300).

Aornz'm] the attack on this place is one of the most celebrated of
Alexander's military operations. See Strabo xv 1 ἓ 8 Ἄορνον δέ τινα
πέτραν, ἧς τὰς ῥίζας ὀ Ἰνδὸς ὑπορρεῖ πλησίον τῶν πηγῶν, Ἀλεξάνδρου κατὰ
μίαν προσβολὴν ἑλόντος, σεμνύνοντες ἔφασαν τὸν Ἠρακλέα τρὶς μὲν προσ-
βαλεῖν τῇ πέτρᾳ ταύτῃ τρὶς δ’ ἀποκρουσθῆναι. See too Art-ian IV 28 ἐξ 1,
2, who says just the same as Curtius, save that he makes no mention of
an earthquake. Diodorus however does‚· see XVII 85.

occupaverunt]:seized in time, before Alexander could catch them.
See on 9 ἓ 32.

coactum] that is eum. The change of subject is remarkable forits
abruptness. See 10 ἓ 10, Livy 1 50 ξ 9, 11 28 ἓ 5.

ξ 3. inopem consiliz] see on rog 27.

siprelt'nm operae esset] ‘ if there were reward for his labour ’= ‘is it
were made worth his while '. Diodorus XVII 85 does not mention this

stipulation in telling the story, and also does not name the amount of
reward, which Curtius here fixes at an incredibly high figure.

ξ 4. constiluit] appointed, agreed. Compare 9§ 19.
