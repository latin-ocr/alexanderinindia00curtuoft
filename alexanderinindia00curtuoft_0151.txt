§g 8—15] A'OTES. 147

occupantur] are forestalledt that is, their own ssurry and the speed
of the current prevented them from executing their orders in time. We
may render ‘ are hinde1·ed ’. For the sense of occupare: compare 5 ξ 24,
and sor celeritate V111 14 ἓ 19.

ἓ 11. in oculis]=e'v ὄμμασιν ‘ before the eyes of'.

maiora] Diodorus says δύο μακραὶ ναῦς. Arrian explains that the
shorter and rounder vessels came off sase and sound, while the longer
vessels came off badly sor the most part, and two sank in consequence of
a collision. See below 9 3¹ τ.

cum et {psa etc] ‘though they too were unmanageable'. Arrian tells
us VI 5 ξ 1 that the sailing-masters so soon as they saw the rapids near
at hand called on their men to row hard in order to keep some steerage-
way on the vessels in the whirling current ahead of them. Curtius im-
plies (and so does Arrian) that any efforts of this kind were not wholly
successful.

innoxia] ‘unhurt '. This passive use is not uncommon in the writers
of the silver age. Compare Lucan lx 892 (gens) a saevo serpentum in-
noxia morsu.

expulsa sunt] ἐξέπεσε, says Diodorus.

ἓ 12. amici ...... nabant] so says Diodorus, and it is a touch that
makes one suspect him as well as Curtius of having made the most οἱ

the danger.

ἓ 13. crgo] seeing the danger threatening srom both-sides, that is, in
either case.

certamine] compare virgil Aen 111 128, 290, V 778.

concitant] the crew, that is.

evei-lucrarentur] ‘ might be beaten out '‚ that is, forced to give place
by the impulse of the vessel's bow. In fact they rowed their very
hardest in order to get some steerage-way on the ship even at the
eleventh hour. Compare lv 3 ξ 18 (at the siege of Tyre) tandem remis
pertinacius everberatum marc veluti eripientibus navigia classicis cessit,
appulsaque sunt litori, lacerata pleraque.

ἓ 14. crederes] Madvigg 370. Compare 9 ἓ 16 below.

inliditur] εἰς τὴν γῆν ἐξέπεσε, says Diodorus.
l . bellum etc] this is sad stuff indeed- Some take crgo to refer back to
t ns.

sacrificio] Diodorus says that he compared this affair to Achilles’
struggle with the river in Iliad xxr. σωθεὶς δὲ παραδόξως τοῖς θεοῖς
ἔθυσεν ὠς μεγίστους ἐκπεφευγὼς κινδύνους καὶ πρὸς ποταμὸν ὁμοίως Ἀχιλλεῖ
διαγωνισάμενος. It is possible. But it is very doubtful whether any
ΞείῙ-Ξο of tthis statement, however faint, is to be sound in cum anmi

ξ 15. Sudracarum] we have here retained the form found in the

MSS and supported by Justin XII 9 ἓ 3. The Greek writers generally
call them Oxydrakae. From Strabo xv 1 ἓ 33 we learn that they lay
