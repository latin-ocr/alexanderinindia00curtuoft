Hephaestione] Diodorus XV ΙΙ 93 ἅμα δὲ τούτοις πραττομένοις ἧκεν
Ηφαιστίων μετα τῆς συναπεσταλμένης δυνάμεως πολλὴν της Ἰνδικῆς κατα-
πεπολεμηκώς. 111 91 he tells us that the expedition· had been directed
against the younger Porus, a statement found also in Arrian V 21 ξ 5.
Curtius treats this as merely a subordinate operation to the main cani-
paign, and such indeed it is.

CHAPTER II.

ἓ 1. supetate] Ritter and Thirlu all argue that this crossing took
place below the junction of the Hypasis (Beyas) with the Hesudrus

same effect. 566 011 IIII 9 ἓ 8. Diodorus says ΧΠΙ 93 τὸν ’Τπανιν
ποταμόν, οὗ τὸ μὲν πλάτος ἣν σταδίων ἑπτσὶ τό δέ βάθος ἓξ ὀργυιῶν τὸ δὲ
ῥεῦμα σφοδρὰν καὶ ὄυσδιάβατον, and we learn from Strabo XV 1 §3¹ 17,

non spatz'o...etc] the construction is changed suddenly, for non
spatio has scd iupedz‘lum parallel to it. spatio is an ablative of cause.

etc.
