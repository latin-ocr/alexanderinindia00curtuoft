Darius¹ was now a fugitive, yet not without some hopes of
better fortune. But Alexander lest him no rest. He pushed on
at once to Persepolis, and early in the following year (330)
entered Ekbatana, the ancient capital of the Medes. Four
years had thus sufficed to drive Darius from his throne and
put the Macedonian king in possession of all the chief scats of
government. His object now was to secure by rapid pursuit
the person of Darius, and in this he nearly succeeded: but
Bessus the Satrap of Baktria and the other traitors who had
accompanied the Great King in his flight² slew their master
themselves when he refused to fly further3 for they feared lest

vacant, and Alexander saw that he must at once ascend 113.
He would thus appear to the nations of the East not only as
a great conqueror but also as the successor of the great Cyrus
by whom the empire lately held by the Persians had of old
been wrested from the Medes. He saw too with the clear
discernment which distinguished him that as Great King he
could no longer remain Macedonian : he must adopt somewhat
of the Oriental pomp and splendour which the subjects of the
Persian government looked for in their ruler: if he would
continue to conquer he must not cease to be an Alexander3
if he would rule over the conquered peoples he must put on
something of a Darius. His Macedonian generals might take
it ill that their young king, with whom they had lived almost as
equals in'the camp and by whose side they had fought at Issus
and Gaugamela, should now withdraw himself from them as a
being apart, and surround himself with the circumstantial for-
malities of an Eastern court; nay more, that he should even
clothe his person in a mongrel dress, wherein a Macedonian
eye jealously marked the Persian garments. But so it must
needs be, for the king had made up his mind on the point and
1116 common soldiers were not deeply moved by the change: so
