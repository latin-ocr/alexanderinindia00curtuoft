§g 11-22] NOTES. 177

misit etc] Diodorus XVII 103 gives substantially the same account of
his messages to the satraps and their prompt attention to his orders.

finitimarum] Diodorus τήν Παρθυαίαν καὶ Δραγγηνὴν καὶ Ἀρείαν.

§ 18. same] it would be more natural to have α fame aster vindim-
tus, but the present construction seems a possible one.

dumtaxal] here ‘at least'.
in Cedrosiae etc] sce on ἓξ 5, 12.
omnium rerum] ‘all sorts of things ‘.

sola] that is, alone of all the districts round. So Miitzell and Zumpt
take it; and emendations are not wanted.

quiete] Arrian VI 27 ἓ 1 makes him rest and refresh his army at the
capital of the Gadrosi, which in ’.ηιξ 1 he calls Ποῦρα. Plutarch Alex
66, 67 says that he found himself in plenty on entering Gedrosia, and
that he gave his men a second rest at the capital of that district. But,
as he makes them march seven days through Kar-mania in the mean
time, we cannot attach much weight to his statement. It is however
clear that there were two accounts of Gedrosia; but, as Arrian and
Strabo agree, we cannot have much hesitation in believing that the
country (at least as sar as Pura) was scorched and barren to the last
degree.

ἓ 19. Leonnati] his victory is mentioned also by Arrian VH 5 ἓ 5,

{ind-23 ἐξ 5, 6. Diodorus gives a version less favourable to the Macc-
ornans.

Cratero] see on ξ 4. This is the first hint we have had from Curtius
as to the whereabouts of Kratems.

Ozinen] Arrian VI 27 ξ 3 speaks of Kraterus bringing one Ordanes
a captured revolter to Alexander.

molientes] compare virgil georg 1 ‘271 insidias avibus moliri.

ἕ 20. Sz'bjwtc‘o] Arrian VI 27 ξ 1 says that he succeeded one Thoas

(successor of Apollophanes) as satrap of Gadrosia, and that he was also
satrap of Karmania.

morbo] so Thoas in Arrian.
ξ ¹21. Aspastes] mentioned only by Curtius.
suspectus voluisse] so Tacitus hist 1 46 suspectus consilia eius fovisse.

dum] used here with its savourite present indicative, though in the
dependent clause aster voluisse. See Madvig ἓ 369 obs 3.
ἓ 22. dum] until such time as. Sec Madvig ξς 360 obs 2.

quae delata erant] the informations laid against them. Arrian VI 27
ἐξ 4, 5 speaks of three satraps Kleander Sitalkes and Herakon whom

the kinggpunished astet enquiry into their conduct. See also Diodorus
XVII 10 .

cum inde] the order of the sense is inde cum. So we might have
cum {gitur or the reverse. For inde=after that, ‘next’, compare ι

ἓ 33-
equorum etc] Arrian vx 27 ἓ 6 gives much the same account.
