152 ρ. CURTJ RUFI [ΗΒΓ ALEX. [ιχ 5

CIIA PTER V.

ἓ t. ad ictus] to meet the blows.

σιτ-τηυιβίεὐαί] was shisting about. Compare vt 1 ἓ 4 undiquc nunc

commmus mmc emmas pm! batur, denque ar ma ειιέιυη]ὶ”’)ι)ι.ς alca tela
clepeo cxajpz'cbat corpore alea vctahat.

stabantque exccptur e] the change os construction here' is very remark-
able. Having begun with clamant1l11aes=ct clamabant, he could not well

have gone on stantcbusque cxccplurt's, and so changed the construction in
the second clause.

cum ille etc] Arrian males him think os only two alternatives‚
sta5ing wheie he uas or jumping into the citadel. Diodorus says xv Η
99 ό δὲ βασιλεὺς ἐρημωθεὶς πάσης βοηθείας ἐτόλμησεν ἐπιτελέσαι πρᾶξιν
παράδοξον καὶ μνῆ μης ἀξίαν. τὸ ’γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους ἀπελθεῖν ἄπρακτον
πρὸς τοὺ ς ἰδίους ἀνάξιον κρίνας ὑπάρχειν τῆς ἰδίας εὐπραξίας καθήλατο μετὰ
τῶν ὅπλων μόνος εις τὴν πόλιν, a much less imaginative way os telling the
tale than that of Curtius.

adflzmam ...... i‘nszgnem] ‘notable rather as conferring a rash repu-
tation than a glorious one’ w e make shift to render it thus, but think
it scarce possible to translate the words satisfactorily. For the con-
struction with ad compare Cic pro Mur ἐξ 29, 38, Lucretius 111 214 with
Munro’s note. See also Kennedy ἓ 70.

samam] here ‘ repnte ' in a neutral sense. It is common in a good
sensez‘renown ’‚ and also occurs in a bad one=‘evil repute ’,
‘notoriety ’. See Cic pro Mur ξ 8.

gloriae] for a definition of gloria see on 10 ἓ ²4 where we again have
gloria and fama distinguished.

ἓ 2. cum vix etc] Arrian VI 9 ἓ 5 (of Alexander’s thoughts) εἰ δὲ
μή, καὶ κινδυνεύειν δέοι, μεγάλα ἔργα καὶτοῖς ἔπειτα πυθέσθαι ἄξια ἐρ’γα-
σάμενος οὐκ ἀσπουδεὶ ἀποθανεῖται.

non inultum] that is, not without having first slain some os the
enemy. Compare virgil Aen 11 670 numquam omncs ltodt'e moriemur
inulti, and in illustration os the sense generally XI 166—165.

ἓ 3. libraverat] had ssung with nice poise. Compare lv 14 ἓ 5
funda saxa librare.

ἓ 4. arbor] Diodorus mentions this, Arrian (locs not.

ἔξιζῄιίίὶιιίί] Diodorus makes him keep the trec on his right, the wall
on is e t.

§7.adfl1te7ct] came pouring on. Compare Livy XXXIX 31 dimi-

cantzbus eis legio quinta supera cml, deinde ut quaeque polueram coplae
affluebant.

perfiegerant] Diodorus only says πολλάς μὲν ’γὰρ εἰς τὸ κράνος
ἐλάμβανε πληγείς.

succiderant] so Lucretius 111 156 succissdne artus (szdcmus)
