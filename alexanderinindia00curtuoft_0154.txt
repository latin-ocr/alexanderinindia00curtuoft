¹50 Q. CURTJ RUFI HlST. ALEX. [1x4

στασιάσαντες ὑπὲρ της ἡγεμονίας. In the sollon' ing account os the cam-

paign Curtius and Diodorus omit the important operations described by
Arrian VI 5—8‚ in which the 51111 and jndgment of Alexander were
shewn to great advantage See 'lhirlwall c 54 (vol VII pp 36—46).

T he siege of the town, which 111 these two authors constitutes the cam

paign is in Arrian only the fmal operation. T hey speak mainly of the
sudiakae. Arrian represents the Malli af< bearinfr the brunt os the uar.

The two accounts are so widely disserent in their general effect that we
must consider them to have been gathered srom different authorities.

Α’-1111111 probably followed l'tolemy‚ so the reference to him by Curtius
(5 5 21)' is most likely no more than an indication that he consulted that
liook 11· hen describing the siege, and found that I’tolemy did not profess
to have been present. Ilad Curtius read I’tolemy' 5 account of the cam-

paign, it 15 hard to see how he could haxe dismissed it so summarily.

’1110 town 11111011 Arrian v t 8 5 4 speaks of as τήν μεγίστην τῶν Μαλλῶν
πόλιν 15 generally placed (as has been mentioned) at Multan. See
below on 5 26.

identidem] with cenatus.

5 25. 711sstnne...1y›sos] the leading notion is contained in these words.
on which stress must accordingly be laid, and not in the chief verb of
the clause pttfitgcrinl.

certe] at all events, ‘anyhow’.

occupa? 'cl unt] escaped 111 111110 to (the hills). Arrianv1 6 ,ὃ 6 speaks
of Perdiccas chasing some 11110 had flod and putting to the 511 ord
ὅσοι γε μή ἔφθασαν ἐς τὰ ἕλη ξυμφυγόντες. But this is quite a different

operation, and there seems to he nothing' 111 Arrian corresponding to the
present affair. Diodorus is also silent.

5 26. Sudracarmu] the siege of this town 15 0110 of Alexander's most
famous exploits. Plutarch also speaks of the Oxydrakae, but Arrian VI
11 53 says αὐτίκα ἐν Ὀξυδράκαις τὸ πάθημα τοῦτο γενέσθαι Ἀλεξάνδρῳ
ὁ mis λόγος κατέχει· τὸ δὲ ἐν Μαλλοῖς ἔθνει αὑτονόαῳἼνόικῷ ξυνέβη, καὶ
ἤ τε πόλις Μαλλῶν ἦν καὶ οἱ βαλόντες Ἀλέξανδρον Μαλλοί, and Strabo xx*
1 5 33 Μαλληί μὲν παρ’ οἷς ἀποθανεῖν ἐκινδύνευσεν Ἀλέξανδρος τρωθεὶς ἐν
ἁλώσει πολίχνης τινός.

5 27. admovebat] compare VIII 9 5 1 movit.

uc committeret ete] we have retained the old reading in preference to
the conjecture of Jeep adopted by Hedicke m' omitteret. at certe .......
'l'he expression committere obsidionem is strange, but it 15 10 be noted
that the substantive is put with dzſjhrrct. Perhaps then we should
rather supply some such 11011011 as pugnam from obsidionem to go with
committeret. committere proelium or pugnam are common enough. ln
’1 III 2 5 6 we have caede commzssa.

(leffe-mel] ue must supply an ut from the preceding ne. See Μᾶὼίς

§46-b

ἓ 28.Demopl10ntcm] Diodorus tells much the same story and gives
11115· soothsayer the same name.
