LJST OF NAMES. 191

basus but before he set out to his government he was killed at a ban-
quet in a fit of anger by Alexander himself whom he had enraged by
sternly rebuking his llattererS.

Coenus] brother in law of Philotas, at whose trial he was one of
the three presiding generals. Probably from a wish to save Philotas
from being tortured he proposed the punishment of stoning. IIe com-
manded a division of the phalanx and was employed by Alexander on
various occasions, as sor instance against Spitamenes whom he defeated.
Accompanying Alexander to India we find him in command of some
cavalry at the battle with Porus. It was Coenus who in the name of
the army strongly dissuaded Alexander from pushing on his conquests
beyond the Hyphasis. He died not long afterwards.

critobulus] a Greek surgeon in the service both of Philip, srom
whose eye he skilfully extracted an arrow, and of Alexander for whom
as Curtius says he extracted the javelin from the wound received at the
siege of the Mallian capital. Arrian however gives the creditos this
operation to one Critodemus.

Craterus] one of the ablest of Alexander-’s Officers but if we may
judge from his conduct at the trial os Philotas not of a very scrupulous
and upright character. Under Parmenio he commanded the infantry
of the left wing at Issus and the cavalry at Gaugamela, and afterwards
was entrusted with one os the divisions of the phalanx. Accompanying
Alexander to India he was employed on numerous occasions where
energy and ability were required. On the return from India he was
sent back by the Bolan Pass to Carmania with the elephants the light
troops and the disabled Macedonians, and arrived in sasety. By Alex-
ander's desire he married Amastris a niece of Darius and was then
despatched with Polysperchon to conduct the discharged veterans back
to Europe. After Alexander's death Greece and the countries to the
north of it fell to the joint regency of Craterus and Antipater whose
daughter he married. Craterus eventually fell in battle against
Eumenes.

Eumenes] is only once mentioned in our period. He was a Greek
of Cardia and a man of great ability. Having become secretary to
Philip he held the same post under Alexander by whom he was em-
ployed not only in civil but also in military operation& On the death
of Alexander he obtained Cappadocia Paphlagonia and Pontus and was
established in his government by Perdiccas. He took a leading part in
the subsequent warS.

Harpalus] who was about the same age as Alexander himself was
banished for his share in the intrigue to bring about the marriage of
Alexander with the daughter of Pixodarus. On Philip's death he was
recalled and accompanied Alexander to Asia as his treasurer, but before
Issus was guilty of peculation and fied to Greece. He was however
recalled and pardoned and placed in charge of the treasury at Ecbatana
with 6000 men. Again he grossly abused his trust and again fied to
Greece on hearing of Alexander’s safe return from India. He was
eventually assassinated in Crete.
