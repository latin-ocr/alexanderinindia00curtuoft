APPENDJX c, 1 37

C. Some extracts from the Alexandra& of Bishop Philippus
Gualterus (Izth or 13th century). These interesting passages
are taken from Miitzell's introduction: he quotes them to illus-
trate certain views as to the history of the MSS of Curtius, from
whom the matter of the poem, and even much of the phraseology,
was taken.

(Ι) ιἠίειτζρίί in mare Ganges

decursurum Achcsim: magnus* occurrit uterque
motibus et rapido inter eos colliditur αεςίιι.

* Probably a misprint sor magnis.
This comes from VIII 9 § 8 where the old reading was Acesines eum
auget. Ganges decursumem in mare intercipit, magnoque mom amnis
uterque colliditur.

(2) iamque Aygrz'va phalanx medium proruperat agmen
Indorum.

So the old reading in VIII 14 ἓ 18 was prorupit.

(3) ausa tamen fiilis Illacetumque resistere famae
gens Sudrachammz.

See note on the name of this tribe in Ix 4 ἓ 15.

(4) obiice nos cuivis portento: ignobile bellum,
degeneres pugnas, obscura pericula νῆα,-
gloria quantalibet vili sordescit in hoste.

So in Ix 6 ἓ 14 bella was read, where pericula is now generally adopted.

D. An abstract of the remarks of Mr J Talboys W'heeler
in his History of India from tlte earliest ages vol 111 c 4 on the
campaigns of Alexander in that country and other matters con-
nected with the same; with a few comments added in brackets.

(a) He accepts the stories of Alexander’s drunkenness and the
weakening of his character, and thinks that the Macedonian phalanx
had already degenerated when the Indian campaigns began. [See
above in the Introduction B 13 sor doubts as to the full acceptance of
this view, though of course it is partly true.]
