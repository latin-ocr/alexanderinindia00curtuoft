eois imitatrix alc-s ab Indis. Elphinstone introd p 10 speaks of ‘ parrots,
or rather peroquets' in India.

invz'sz‘lata] some editors prefer the form inusitata here and in IX 1
§ 4 and other places, Both words are recognized and there is hardly
any perceptible difference in sense. Miitzell on V 5 §1 7 discusses the

‘unknoan The frequentative foim has here as in many other cases
lost its proper meaning. See for instance virgil Aen VI 258 ad 'ent
ante dna. The strange animals referied to are probably the gold-
