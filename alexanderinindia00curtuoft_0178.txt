174 Q. CURTJ RUFI HIST. ALEX. [lx 10

agrees] place the time of departure in the latter part of the summer, that
of the ssent in the autumn. Miit7ell observes that Plutarch Alex 66
assigns seven, not tin months, as the time spent in sailing down the
rivers ,and so probablv followed another account, which may have been
the same as that followed by Curtius. An>lww it would bring him to
Patala in April, not (as Aristobulus says) in July.

urbes] Arrian speaks of the town and station at Patala and of
sundry naval stations. Curtius is probably making the most of the state-
ments of his authorities, whatever they were.

plet‘asqm] simply ‘a number ', ‘ many '. So in Tacitus hist 1 39, 86
we find flerique opposed to plures.

§3. Abarclm] he was the admiral'(va13npxos) and Onesikritus the
head pilot or sailing-master (ἀρχικυΒερνὴτης) of the fleet. We know
that there was a jealousy between them (Strabo xv 2 ξ 4), sor which the
latter was probably to blame, as he proved himself in his account of
Alexanders expedition a steady and enormous liar (see Strabo xv ι
passzm) and in particular affirmed that he had himself been ναύαρχος of
the lieet. 'the παράπλους of Nearchus was a work of considerable
ment.

deducerent etc] Diodorus XVII 104 τὸν δὲ λοιπὸν στόλον παραδοὺς
Νεάρχῳ καί τισιν ἀλλοις τῶν φίλων προσέταξε τὴν παραλίαν πᾶσαν παρα-
πλεῦσαι δι’ ὠκεανοῦ καὶ πάντα κατασκεψαμένους ἀπαντᾶν ἐπὶ τὰς ἐκβολὰς
τοῦ Εὐφράτου ποταμοῦ. Arrian Indica 20 ἐξ 1—3 says (quoting Nearchus)
that Alexander wanted to go on this voyage himself, but abandoned it
from motives of prudence. XVhen searching for a trusty admiral he
received an offer from Nearchus to undertake the business.

ἓ 4. crematis] so says Diodorus.

exercitum] not the whole, for a part had been sent offundet Kraterus
through Karmania. For details see Arrian Vt 17 ἕ 3, Strabo xv 2 ἓ 5.

§ 5. Arabiton] Diodorus calls them Ἀρβΐται, Strabo Ἀρβιες,
Arrian Ἀραβ ται m his Anabasis, Ἀράβιες in his Indian history. Their
further or western boundary was the river variously called Ἀρβις,
Ἀράβιος, Ἀράβις and Arabus. Beyond this river lay the Oritae, and
beyond them again the Gedrosii Gadi-osii or Kedrosii. The words
inde ...... Cedrosmrmn are obviously wrong. But, as has been already
observed by Vogel. they may very well for all that have been written by
Curtius himself, for Diodorus speaks of the submission of τοὺς τὴν
Κεδρωσίαν οἰκοῦντας immediately after that of the Arbhae, and then goes
on to mention the Oritae, returning further on to the march through
Κεδρωσία, as Curtius does below. They probably both followed the same
authorities, in which there may have been some confusion to account for
their strange muddle. It 15 remarkable that Arrian Vl 22 ξ 1 mentions
Gadrosian troops as having assisted the Oritae to oppose the entrance of
Alexander into the territory οἱ the latter. See on 5' η iununta and ς 18
quiete.

liber] Ἀραβῖται, ἔθνος καὶ τοῦτο αὐτόνομον, says Arrian Vl 21 ἓ 4.
dedidit sc] Arrian and Diodorus agree with this statement.
