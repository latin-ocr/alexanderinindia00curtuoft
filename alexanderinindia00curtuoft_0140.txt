136 Q. CURTJ RUFI HIST. ALEX. [1x2

the wearisome harangue supplied to his readers by Arrian v 2 5, 26, wilt
see the great superiority os Curtius both in imagination and expression.

per hos dicu] ⁴ during these last days '. That is, the two days os rest
and part os the day on which he is speaking. See s* 1.

ἓ 13. inprovisa] unexpcrienced, unknown. Compare vill 13 ἓ 11.
Such is perhaps also the meaning in 9 ξ 11, but the common one is
‘ unexpected ’, ‘ unsorc’seen ’.

ff ῑναιὲϊαὲ] salsehood, lying. So below§ 17. See Holden on Cic de
0 111 5 .

fauces] these are the ‘gates’ (πύλαι) or ‘passes' from Cilicia into
Syria. See 111 4 ἓξ 1 1, 12 A lesi-ander fauces iugi, quae Pylae appellantur.
intravit. contemplatus locorum situm non alias magis dicitur admiratus
essefi¹licilalem suam .· obrui poluisse vel saxis confitebatur, si fitissent qui
in subeuntes propellerent. iter vix quaternos capiebat armatos .· dorsum
moniis inminebat viae non ailgmlae modo sed plerumque praeruptae, cre-
bris obcrranlibus rivis, quiex radicibus. montium manant. This was on
the way to the battle of Issus.

campos] where the battle of Gaugamela or Arbela was fought.

vado] namely the Tigris, os which Curtius says 1v 9 ἓ 15 paucos
equilum ad templandum va d u m fluminis praemisit.

ponte] namely the Euphrates, of which he says 1v 9 ἓ 12 ad Euphra-
tem pcivenit quo pontibus innclo ...... ete.

ἓ 14. acl liquidum] to the clear, to clearness. That is. to a state of
transparency so that one can look through and see what the fact is which
underlies these obscure and distorted statements. Compare Velleius
1 16 ἓ 1 res ad liquidum ratione perducat, Quintilian V 14 ἓ 28.

illa tradente] when she hands them on, that is, when she is the
medium through which they are conveyed.

cum sit ex solido] ‘though testing on a real foundation ’. That is,
a foundation of fact. Compare solidius &⁷111 ¹4 ἓ 46, and Virgil Aen XI
426, 427, multos alterna revisens lusit et in solido rursus fortuna locavit.

nominis quam operis] here we have probably no more than an

attempt to express the common Greek antithesis between ὄνομα. and
ἔργον, ‘name’ and ‘reality’.

«ἓ 15. sustineri] compare ἓ 22, IX 5 ἓ 18.

ἓ 16. armentormn] cattle. See V111 12 ἓ 11. The word is con·
nected with the root of aro.

difficilius] Strabo however XV 1 ξ 4² says ‘and they are seldom
hard to ta1ne3 sor they are naturally of a mild and gentle disposition, so
as closely to resemble a rational animal (λογικῷ ζώῳ) ’.

g 17. nam flumen etc] the connexion of the sense seems to be this.
[The other obstacles are exaggerated‚ and so is the breadth of the rivers:
but this even if taken sor granted would afford no proof of their being
hard to cross] ‘For a river' etc. Alexander seems to be pointing out
that the croakers have for once overshot their mark.
