‚S 39. inuisum] ⁴ trained ’.
ξ 40. spoliari iubet] only Curtius states this.

cum belna...inpo'ncrc] Plutarch Alex 60 has got hol¹l os a still
more wonderful account of the sagacity os this beast. Strabo xv 1 ξ 4²
says of trained battle elephants ol δὲ καὶ ἐξαίμους τοὺς ἡνιοχους ἐν τοίς
ἀγῶσι πεσόντας ἀνελόμενοι σώζουσιν ἐκ τῆς μάχης, τοὺς δέ ὑποδύντας μεταξὺ
τῶν προσθίων ποδῶν ύπερμαχόμενοι διέσωσαν.

ἓ 4¹. malum] this interjection, common in the comit: poets. is also
found in Cicero. See the passage (le osf 11 ξ 53 praeclare m cpt'slula
(suculam Alexandrum filium Philippus accusat quod largitione benevolen-
liam ,llaccdonmn consectetur. ‘ quac· le. malum’ inquit ‘ rasio 7'11 islam
spem induxit ut eos tibi fideles pularcs sin-e quos pecum'a corrupisses?
Render ‘ what the plague was the infatuation that drove you'...

zmilis] the genitive is that of further definition aster ammplam.
See on 10 3· 7 ignia

l ἓ 4²· ficz'sti] granted, given. So osten J‘chere copiam patestatem
scentiam ete.

ἓ 43. rursus...esset] Arrian V 19 ἓ 2 says that when asked byAlex-
ander how he would like to be treated, Porus-replied ‘like a king' (Βασι-
λικῶς). Curtius seems to have got hold os something not very different
from this, and to have dressed it up after the fashion of the rhetoricians
with a sage reflection on the xnutability of fortune, in order to point his
moral.

§44. iuſs-actam] ‘broken down', ‘dismayed’. The word is very
common. Compare lx 2 ἓ 30, Virgil Aen xli 1.

ἓ 45. aegrum curavit] Diodorus XVII 89 says αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Πῶρος
ἔμπνους ὢν παρεδόθη τοῖς Ἰνδοῖς πρὸς τήν θεραπείαν, that is probably to
some of the Brahman doctors.

lcaml secus quam] :haud minus quam.

confirmatum] when he recovered his strength.

ampliore] so Arrian V 19§ 3 τήν τε ἀρχὴν τῷ Πόρῳ τῶν τε αὐτοῦ
Ἰνδῶν ἔδωκε καὶ ἀλλην ἔτι χώραν πρὸς τῇ πάλαι οὔσῃ πλείονα τῆς πρόσθεν
προσέθηκε, and again in detail 20 θ’ 4, ²9 ἓ 2.

ξ 46. nec s‹me...gl0rz'ae] ‘and in truth his nature had no more es-
sential or more permanent quality than a regard sor true merit and
renown'. See on lx 2 ἓ ¹4 cx solido.

simplicius...in cive] ‘but he took more impartial account os glory in
an enemy than ina subject’. Compare iv 14§ ¹9 praetcrea breves ct
mutabiles vices rerum sunt, ct Jiv‘lmm numquam simpliciler indulget,
‘never shews favour without reserx·e⁷. For aestimabat compare lxx

ἓ ²6alemini] unbuilt, pulled down.
