(b) Alexandcr's original dcsign was to penetrate to the Ganges and
conquer the great empire then existing on its banks. To do this he
must conqucr the smaller kingdoms ou his way. Os the three Punjab
kingdoms that os the ‘ elder’ Porus was the most important: and from
the eminence assigned to him it appears that his authority emended, in
name at least, over the others. Thus he would be a sort os suzerain of
the Punjab, a view confirmed by the IIindu tradition of the empire os
Puru in these parts. The so-called hostile sovereigns (Taxiles and the
younger Porus) were originally nothing more than refractory vassa!
kings. Under the non-cohesive system of Asiatic monarchies such
nominal supreinacy is osten retained long aster the political ties have
been virtually destroyed. Alexander deeined it politic to treat the
resractory vassals as iudependent sovereigns.

(c) Alexander ·had learnt that in Asiatic warsare the chief danger
lay in the rear, and accordingly was caresul to secure the real submission
of the tribes as he passed. Liberal to ready submission and to obstinate
resistance, he sternly repressed revolts and punished deception. His
message to the Indian princes, requiring their submission‚ was probably
sent by him as Great King of Persia to whom the whole region (Cabul
and the Punjab) had been tributary in a previous generation (Herodotus
111 94, 95, 102). After subduing the Assacani and taking Aornos, he
made the kingdom of Taxiles his base of operations sor crossing the
Jhelum. The battle is one of the most remarkable actions in ancient
story, and the passage of the river a wonderful seat. The results of his
victory were most important. He was able to form a sseet on the
Jhelum, a measure (1116 both to his soldierly instinct of precaution and to
his imagination. He at first took the Indus sor the Nile.

(d) After crossing the Chenab and Ravee without oppositi0n‚ he
was called back to reduce the rebellious Kathaei to obedience. These
seem to have been Rajpoots: at least their customs were os a Rajpoot
character. But his plans were srustrated by the sullen resistance of his
Macedonian soldiers. “Their spirits had been broken, not so much by
the toils os war, as by the wind and rain of the south-west monsoon;
and by this time their love of ease and sensual gratification had blunted
that passion sor glory and dominion which had formerly animated the
phalanx”. So they would not advance beyond the Sutlej. So he
turned. back and proceeded along the Jhelum and Indus through Scinde
and thence through Beloochistan to Susa.
