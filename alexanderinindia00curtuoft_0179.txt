g 2—11] NOTES. 175

§ 6. ibi maiorem etc] Diodorus and Arrian agree in substance
with this account οῖ’ the march and laying waste os the country of the
Oritae.

ἓ 7. urbem] so says Diodorus and tells us that its name was Alex-
andria. Arrian VI 21 ἕ 5 says only that he praised a certain spot as
suited sor the development of a great city.

Arachosii] this statement rests on Curtius' authority alone.

§8- 711a1‘1'l1'mas ludos] these are clearly the same as those whom
Diodorus xvll 105 calls ἔθνος ἄξενον καὶ παντελῶς θηριῶδες, and to whom
other writers give the name Ichthyophagi. But it is remarkable that
Arrian Vl 28 ς’ 5, Indica. 24—29juzssim speaks of their being visited by
Nearchus, not by Alexander, and this is perhaps the more probable
version of the story, unless we refer this passage of Curtius to the ex-
ploring party under Thoas, sent by Alexander to survey the coast district.
See Arrian Vi ²3 §g 2, 3. Pliny N H VI ξ 95.

commcrct'z' iure] ‘intercourse ³, perhaps in the way of exchange.
The word ins means ‘ right ' or ‘rightsul relation ⁹, and the expression
ms commercii is important in early Roman history, See note on Vin 9
ς’ 19.

ἓ 9. zspsa] ‘ of itself ', opposed to natura queque ‘ even by nature ’.

efferavit] ‘has made savage'. Compare V111 2 ἓ 16 lum ferocia
ingenia non bellum modo sed clmm vestiae desperalio cffv‘avcrat.

ingenia] ‘characters '. The following account of this loathsome
tribe is in strict agreement with the other authorities.

ξ 10. tuguria] these are the huts called by Arrian Ind 24 ἓ 2
stifling cabins' (ἐν καλύβῃσι πνιγηρῇσι). The following account of
them corresponds with the more detailed descriptions in Strabo XV 2
ᾗ 2, Diodorus XVII 105, Ari-ian lnd ²9 ἕ 19, 30 ξς· 8, 9, anab Vi 23 ξ 3.
conchis] Arrian Vl 23 ξ 3 ξυνθέντας τοὶς κόγχας.
pmgamcnlis] off-scourings, refuse. The other writers inform us that

these were the bones of whales or other huge animals (κήτη) cast up by
t ie sea.

pellibus] so Diodorus. δορὰς θηρίων. Arrian Ind 24 ἓ 9 says that
some wore thick fish hides.

sole duratis] Strabo and Arrian Ind ²9 §g 9-1 3 say that they catch
fish in nets made os palm-bark‚ and then dry the larges ones in the sun
and grind them when dried into meal and even bake the meal into
loaves. From Pliny N H VII ξ 30 we learn that Klitarchus is his
authority sor this statement, and Curtius probably took it also srom the
same source. See Pomponius Mela 111 8.

eiscit] so Diodorus σιτοῦνται δέ τὰ ἐκβαλλόμενα κήτη σαρκοφαγοῦν-
τες, and the rest agree.

ξ 1 1. igilur] the country supplying no food.
ad ullz'mmn] ‘at last ’‚ ‘ in the end'. So aa' extremum.

radices palmauum] Strabo XV ‘z ἓ 5, Arrian VI 23 ἕ 6, Indica 26
ξ 6, 29 ξ 1 mention only the fruit (βάλανοι ?dates) and pith (ἐγκέφαλος)
