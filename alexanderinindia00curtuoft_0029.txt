fully deserved this title, if ever man did. Asa warrior, hc
rivalled the finest soldiers of his army in endurance of toil and
hardship and in reckless bravery on the battle-field3 while few
even of the greatest generals have equalled him in the patient
and skilful sorethought with which his pians were laid, or in
the speed and vigour with which he carried them out. Even

his lieutenants (Antipater and others) he wrote constantly, and also to
Aristotle and Leonidas his teachers‚ to Pausanias the doctor, to Phokion
at Athens, to the Athenians etc, and also kept journals of his doing-5
