position of his history has been fixed variously by disserent
c1·itics; some find therein an allusion to Augustus, others to
Claudius, to Vespasian, or even to Septimius Severus. Of
these interpretations that which refers the words to the
accession of Claudius seems the most plausible. And with
this view, which would place him between Velleius and I’e-

a series of interesting pictures, and by a quiet and compressed
narrative to bind them into a whole: so that we should fairly
judge him not by the bare and lit'elcss passages which serve
to make transition, but rather by the more effective scenes‘ss
which he has set himself specially to pourtray. This view of
his purpose suits well with the probable opinion that he followed
