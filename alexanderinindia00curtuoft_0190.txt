from his head (sor so it was the customc to speake unto the kyng) they
began to require hym that he woulde utter the cause os the whole army.
'l'hen Cenus beganne in this wyse: The Goddes defende our myndes
srom all wicked thoughtes (as 1 doubt not but they wyll) there is none os
your souldiers but be of the same mynde towardes you that they have bene
in tymes past. Whether it be your pleasure to commaunde them to go
sorwardes, to syght, to hasarde them selves, or with their bloud commend
your name unto the posteritie. And is you will nedes persever in your
opinion, though we be unarmed naked and without blond, we will
either come aster you or go before, as you shall thynke expedient. But
is you wyll be content to heare the grieses and complayntes os your
souldiers that be not fayned but expressed by soree of very necessitie, I
humblie beseche you then that ye woulde vouehesave savourably to heare
thern, that constantly have solowed your authoritie and fortune, and are
yet redy to solow wheresoever you wil appoynte. O Alexander, with
the greatnes of your actes ye have not overco ne only your enemies, but
also your owne souLdiers. Whatsoever mans mortalitie is able to sulsyll,
that is persourmed by us, having passed over so manye Seas and countreys
better knowen to us then to the very inhabiters, nowe remayning in
maner in the uttermoste ende of the worlde. And yet for all this, your
purpose is to passe into an other worlde and seke out an Inde unknowen
to the Indians. Ye covet to plucke out the wilde beastes and serpentes
out os their (lennes & lurking places, minding to serche further with
your victory then the sonne hath visited w‘ her beames, which truly is an
imaginacit') mete for your hatte, but sarre exceding our capacitie and
power. Your manhode and courage is alwayes an encrease, but our force
groweth in deelinacion. Behold our bodies destitute of blond, perced
with so many woundes, and rotted with so many scarres. Our weapons
nowe be dulled, and our arinour is wasted Sc consumed, we weare our
apparell aster the Percias maner, because our countrey garmentes do saill¹
us. We are degenerate out of our own sasshion, δε growen into a
strafige habite. What is he that hath his corselet or horse particuler to
himself? Cause it to be enquired how many servantes do solowe their
maisters and what remaineth to every mi of the spoyle. Being the
victorers of al me, of all men we are the poorest.
