§g 24—-33] NOTES. 151

(vol vu p 40). In place of the testy specches which Curtius assects to
report, Diodorus only says ό δὲ βασιλεὺς τούτῳ μὲν ἐπέπληξεν ὼς ἐμπο-
δίζοντι τὴν ἀρετὴν τῶν ἀγωνιζομένων, and the more sober Arrian says
nothing os the affair.

l' ut he says that this was against the citadel u all, the town having been
carried at the first assault. So too Diodorus. Plutarch Alex 630 seems
to make it the town wall, as Curtius does.

angusta] the narrowness was in the top of the parapet running round
the wall, which was not marked ont along its npper edge with battle-
ments (pinnac), but was built in an unbroken line of breastwork (pcr-
pclua lorica) which was in the way of assailants (οὐιίιιῑία), preventing
their getting over (transitum). See Merivale c 58 (VII p 170).

murc] see on ἓ 19.

corona] the use of this word to signify the defensive parapet of a wall
is very strange. Arrian VI 9 ξ 4 calls it ἡ ἔπαλξις.

ἓ 3¹· imque rex etc] ‘the king then was rather clinging to than
standing up on the edge (of the parapet) warding off with his shield the
‹larts that fell upon him from every side: for on all sides he was now
made a mark sor shot from the towers ’. Curtius seems here to picture
him at the moment when, having climbed 011 to the edg e of the corona and
having both his feet on it, he u soum at the same time be obliged to rest
his right hand also on the edge, in order to gain the steadiness necessary
sor the manipulation of his shield as a protection from the shower of
missiles with which he was assailed.A1rian v 1 9 ἓ 4 seems to speak of
him at an earlier stage, just before he took his feet from the Iadder.
His words are ἤδη τε πρὸς τῇ ἐπάλξει τοῦ τείχους ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν, καὶ
ἐρείσας ἐπ’ αὐτῇ την ἀσπίδα τοὺς μὲν ὤθει εισω του τείχους τῶν Ἰνδῶν, τοὺς
δὲ καὶ αὐτοῦ τῴ ξίφει ἀποκτείνας ’γεγυμνώκει τὸ ταύτῃ τεῖχος.

eminus] merely shews that the weapons with which he was being
assailed were of a missile character.

ἓ 3²· nec subire ...... obruebantur] probably a piece of gratuitous
padding put in by Curtius to heighten the effect of his picture. Nothing
os the kind is found in Arrian or Diodorus.

subire] to mount the wall.
