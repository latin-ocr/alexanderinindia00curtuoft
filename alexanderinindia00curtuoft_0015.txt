mainly the authority of Klitai-chus¹‚ an Alexandr-ine historian
who wrote about 300 BC, and is said to have sacrificed truth
to effect3 not trusting to the solid merits of his work (which
were considerable) but seeking to render it attractive by
fabulous and exaggerate& descriptions. Probably Curtius,
whether drawing direct from Klitarchus or not, dressed up
or recast many of his exaggerations as he saw fit at the time,
but was too sober to load his book with recounting other
marvels which were most likely at once dreary and incredible.
There is also reason to think that Curtius, though in the
main a reporter rather than a historian‚ did sometimes3 check
the statements of his guide by those of more trustworthy
authors such as Ptolemy‚ who with Aristobulus is the writer
most relied upon by the judicious A1·rian‘². While therefore we
must conclude that much in the work before us is overdrawn‚
the singular accuracy observable in many small points⁵ and
in some descriptions of places6 sorbids us to regard it as a
mere romance to be ranked with Xenophon’s Cyrepaedia or

Pliny the elder reports sorne of his marvels in the ‘ Natural History,’
and Strabo in his Geography. See in particular Strabo VII 2 ἓ 1.
From Diodorus Π 7 and Strabo XI 5 ξ 4 it has been wrongly inserted
that he had been with Alexander on his expedition. For a definite

and unsavourable opinion of him see Cic de legibus Ι ξ 7.

Peter the Great § 7 ‘ une troisiaeme espssre de mcnsonge, et la plus grossic‘re
de tontes, mais qui fut lougtcmps la plus sttlzcz'sante. c'csl le meweillmx:

The last sentence is a little too sweeping, but not much. Lucian's
papers called ‘ A true history ’ and ‘ How to write history ‘ are not quite
so sweeping in their denunciation but to the full as severe.
