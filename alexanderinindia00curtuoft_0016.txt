12 JNTRODUCTJOM

nexion maintained by Roman writers between rhetoric and
history1—particularly in the days os the empire—this is only
what we should expect. The same may be said in various
degrees of Sallust Livy and Tacitus. This, as well as the
epigrammatic sentences with which his work is studdcd‚ is
nothing but the natural result osan age of recitations², when
books were composed rather with a view to affor-d a choice
of extracts fit to tickle the ears of a lecture-roem audience
than to supply solid information to the student in his closet.
So too, if not critical, he is to some extent imaginative³z he
is seldom at a loss to infer the motive sor an action, or draw
a bold and appropriate moral.

(3) It has often been remark-ed that Curtius was an imi-
tator of Livy, and-this is an indubitabte fact. It has also
been well pointed out by Vogel that, if we suppose him to
have published his book in 41 or 42 AD, it is quite credible
that he may in his youth have seen and even been a pupil
of that eminent master. All that has been said above of his
merits and desects as a writer in respect os manner and matter
will apply with slight modification to Livy also; and the two

¹ Quintilian x 1 ἓξ 31—34 allows the oratorical student to read
history, but sparingly‚ as it is a sort of poetry in prose, et sm’be'turad
narrandum non ad probandum. It has a sort os poetic license in ex-
pression, so as to enliven the narrative. The conciseness of Sallust is
wasted on a jury, neque illa Livii lactea ubertas satis docebit eum qui non
speciem expositionis sed fidem quaerit. In digressions the orator may
now and then allow himself the sleek plumpness of historical style. In
sact the orator must be content generally with a tamer style than the
historian. So too Pliny epp v 8 §3¹ 9—11‚ though vll 17 ἓ 3 has another
sound. The pretensions of Livy in his presace are not to be taken
as meaning the same as we now should by the same words. Style had
in fact with all ancient historians an undue prominence. So Tacitus
Agr 10 refers to Livy and Rusticus as eloquentissimi auctores when
merely citing a statement ostheirs.

² See Mayor on Juvenal 111 9, particularly pp 180, 181, where their
effect in causing the whole of a book to be sacrifieed to the parts is
clearly and sully detailed : a-lso Quintil 1 8 ἓ 9.
