remarkable bend: this was itself ov ergroun uith all sorts of trccs, aud
over against it lay an island in the river, a wooded untrodden and
solitary place. When hc observed this island opposite the bluff, two
woocled spots suited to cover the attempt at crossing, he decided to tal e
his army over this way. Now the bluff and the island were distant as
much as ¹50 stadia from the great camp '.

Jbssa] comparing Arrian quoted above (ἀνέχουσα) we must'infer that
thisfhssa is the hollow behind the bluff (ἄκρα). For the sense compare
virgil Aen XI 522 cst curvo mzfractu valles adcommoda fraudi armorum-
que dolis.

Ptolomaeum] so Hedicke, following the MSS authority, spells the
name. Anyhow Curtius seems to have made a mistake here. In ¹4
ξ 15 he represents Ptolemy as being in the immediate company of the
king, and Arrian writing mainly from Ptolemy's own accounts (V 7 ἓ 1,
¹4 ξ 5) says that it was Craterus who was lest in charge of the army
sacing Porus at the ford (V 11 ἓ 3,), and adds (ἓ 4) παρηγγέλλετο δὲ

his plan of turning his enemy‘s right flank by crossing higher up.

ξ 21. Attalum] Arrian V η ἓ 1 mentions Attalus with other offi-
cers as detailed off for a third attack between the other two. But his
presence in the character of Alexander at the sham headquarters is not
as Mtitzell seems to think inconsistent with the duty assigned to him by
Arrian. He might wait there till the time of the intended night-attack
and then at once join his detachment in time for action. In saet this is
