θάνατος· προηγοῦνται δὲ τυμπανισταὶ καὶ κωδωνοφὸροι. κυνηγετεῖ δ’ ἐν

τρεῖς γυναῖκες), ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἀφράκταις θήραις ἀπ’ ἐλέφαντος· αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες
αἱ μὲν ἐφ’ ἁρμάτων αἱ δ’ ἐφ’ ἵππων αὶ δὲ καὶ ἐπ’ ἐλεφάντων, ὡς καὶ συστρα-

vivario] a royal park or forest, senced round (περίφραγμα) and sull
os game. In V111 1 ἐς· ιι-ι3 we have an account os a similar enclosure
(called a sallus) in Sogdiana, os vast size, having walls and towers sor
the accominodation of the hunters. The beasts in it had enjoyerl an
unhroken quiet sor [our generations before they were disturbed by
Alexander.

binum cubilomtm] Zumpt remarks that distributive numerals com-
monly have the genitive plural cont1·acted. See in general on the
question of form the well-known passage Cic. orator ἓξ 155—-157,
Miitzell here well compares Pliny N H V ξ 34p11l1’05 lamen lmul difficile
binum firme cubitorum allilzldine invsuinnt. These arrows seem to
have been something like the ‘eloth-yard shasts’ of our English sore-
fathers. Strabo xv 1 ἓ 66 assigns them οἰστοὺς τριπήχεις on the autho-
rity os Nearchus.

maiore nisu etc] Curtius repeats this in 13 §6‚ ηιξ 19, but 10 ἓ 6,
lx 5 ἓξ 9, 24 can hardly be reconciled with the statement, which is also
set aside by the testimony of Arrian Indica 16 ἐξ 6, 7 (apparently sol-
Iowing Nearchus) οἰ μὲν πεζοὶ αὐτοῖσι τόξον τε ἔχουσιν ἰσᾶμηκες τῷ
φορέοντι τὸ τόξον, καὶ τοῦτο κάτω ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν θέντες καὶ τῳ ποδὶ τῷ
ἀριστερῷ ἀντιβάντες οὕτως ἐκτοξεύουσι τὴν νευρὴν ἐπὶ μέγα ὀπίσω ἀπαγα-

τερὸν ἐγένετο. See also Julian 205 (1, Plutarch Alex 63, regum et imper

pondere] Livy would hardly have written such loose stuff as this:
see at least v11 ²3 ξ 8, ix 19 ς 7, xxx 105 13, also Virgil Aen ix 704
—708.

ξ 20. equo etc] Arrian Indica 17 ,ἓξ 1, ‘z ὀχήματα δὲ τοῖσι μὲν πολ-
λοῖσιν Ἰνδῶν κάμηλοί εἰσι καὶ ἰ’πποι καὶ ὄνοι, τοῖσι δὲ εὐδαίμοσιν ἐλέφαντες.

ἄτιμον. See also Strabo xv 1 ἐξ 41, 43, and Curtius himself 12 ἓ δ,
14 ἓ 13.

vehunt currum] Curtius seems to be thinking of a howdah3 or
perhaps, since elephanti is in the plural, he may refer to something like
the Great Kaan'sgold-plated litter, borne by sour elephants, mentioned
