ι 30 Q. CURTJ RUFI Hssz ALEX. [ιχ ι

a hill still bearing the same name, between the Hyarotis (Hydraotes)
and Acesines. Alexander must then have turned back sor a space.

as he had according to Arrian v αι § 6 already crossed the former
river.

palude] Arrian V ²3 ξ 4 ἵνα καὶ λίμνη οὑ μακρὰν τοῦ τείχους ἥν. IIe
goes on to say that it was not deep.

§ 15. vehiculis] in three rows, according to Arrian ἠ ἓ 4 κύκλῳ δὲ
τοῦ ’γηλόφου ἁμάξας περιστήσαντες ἐντὸς αὐτῶν ἐστρατοπέδευον, ὼς τρι-
πλοῦν χάρακα περιβεβλῆσθαι τῶν ἁμαξῶν.

dcla] wcapons of offence. Compare 4 ξ 3.

transilz'clurnlque] there is here a change of subject. The sentence
goes on as if tela alii hastas alii secures habehant had been written

above. 'she word seems to denote the jumping srom one waggon to
another.

ἓ 16. incondito] ‘un‹lisciplined’.

auxilio] ‘means -os warsare’‚ ‘sorce'. Compare IV 9 ἓ 4salcatae
quadrigam, unicum illarum genlz'um auxilium, and V111 14 ξ 6.

ab utroque latere] this can hardly refer to the same move as that
mentioned below qno...ct'rcumvenhwzlur. It would seem then that
Curtius is following some account in which the waggons were not

ranged round the town, but in a line so as to serve as a rampart to an
army covering the town.

§ ¹7· vincula etc] this account does not correspond with that os
Arrian V ²3 ἓ 2 who mentions gaps between the waggons and says
nothing of any means of binding them together.

qnofizczlfius] Madvig ἓ 440 b obs 1, Kennedy ξ 208.

vm milibus] it is impossible to compare the numbers given by
Curtius and Arrian 24 §js 3, 5, as neither gives the total os killed and
the details of the numbers who sell in the separate operations os the
siege are not so stated as to admit of comparison.

ἓ 18. scalis] Arrian 24 ἓ 4 says that they also weakened the walls
by mining.

paucis] emphatic.
qm] =ii qui.
profecto] goes closely with deorum. Compare 8 ξ 18.

ξ 19. Eumeni] Arrian v 24 ἓξ 6, 7 has a similar but slightly different
account.

ad urbem] see on 4 ξ ²3·

ἓ 20. deprecamnlur] to win over, appease. Compare νη 2 ἓ 7
amici quoque dam misericordiae occasione consurgunt flentesque regem

deprecantur. So παραιτεῖσθαι in Greek. Compare Aristoph vespae
Ι 2 57 ἢ γὰρ παρῃτήσαντο τὸν πεπονθότα.

§en inminebant] were inclined to, bent on. Compare v 11 ἓ 2
ipse currum reglis· sequebalur, occasioni inminens adloquendi cum, vt ιο
§ 22 sic ergo imperio, quod dedignor, inminco, Suet Aug 24.
