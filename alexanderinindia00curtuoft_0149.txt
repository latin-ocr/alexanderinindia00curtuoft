4 ξ 1—8] NOTES. 143

Herculis] this same story is preserved by Strabo xv 1 ξ 8, Diodorus
xvn 96, Ari-ian Indica 5 ς’ 12. The last cites it as an instance of the
inventions that were occasioned by Alexander's expedition. Hercules
was generally represented with a lion's skin and a elul>-

§4. ltine] from the land of Sibi. The word goes with excessit.
We leam from Diodorus that the Sibi received Alexander kindly and
that he in return treated them well.

§5. milia gens] the reading alia is found only in the Paris MS.
1t seems better to keep the old reading than to insert alia before gens
and then to emend this assumed reading into Agalasses as Vogel does
iu his text merely because Diodorus names the people thus XVII 96 κατα-
λαβὼν δὲ τοὺς ὀνομαζομένους ἈὙαλασσεΐς ἠθροικότας πεζοὺς μὲν τετρα-
κισμυρίους ἱππεῖς δὲ τρισχιλίους, συνάψας αὐτοῖς μάχην καὶ νικήσας τοὺς
μὲν πλείστους κατέκοψε τοὺς δὲ λοιποὺς συμφυγόντας εἰς τὰς πλησίον
πόλεις ἐκπολιορκήσας ἐξηνδραποδίσατο. We must observe that only one
gens (those of the rcgz'o and oppidum above) seem to be meant here.

fluminum] either the stream formed by the junction of the Hy-
daspes with the Acesines, or perhaps, the Hydaspes and some small
tributary stream (the name of which Curtius has not recorded) are re-

ferred to.
quae] that is, the milia peditum.
amne] probably a tributary stream.

inclusos] that is the whole population, not merely the remains of the
milla peditum.

expugnat] eos. For this word used with the people (not the place)
sor its object see VI 6 ἓ 25 ad eapzqgrmmtlos eos, qui edita montium occu-
paverant, redit, Tacitus hist V 12, Agr 41.

ξ 6. alteram...amisit] Diodorus XVII 96 says just the same.

sed...cremant] Diodorus sam, ‘and having in his anger set fire to the
city he burnt in it most of the inhabitants: but some of the surviving
natives took refuge in the citadel and addressed him as suppliants‚
bearing olive-branches. These he let go free, to the number of 3000'.
The account in Curtius is quite as probable as that in Diodorus, and
similar instances of desperation have been known in later times. But
it must be confessed that Curtius seems here to be straining after
effect.

§¹7. adeo etc] ‘so completely does war iuvert natural relations'.

naturae iura] the natural rights or relations of rnen to each other,
or to some other object, as a person or place. Compare VII 8 § 28

amicilia est .· etiam in pace belli lamen iura servamur, where belli iura
