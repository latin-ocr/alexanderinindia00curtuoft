(stadia) in altitudinem excedit. Miitzell remarks that the parts spoken
os are the Vindhya mountains and the Deckan.

plana] this bold statement is rather sweephrg, but more nearly accu-
rate than that of Pliny N 11 VI ἓ 60 where speaking of the northern
mountains he says z'ungunlur inter se Imaus Emodus Hzropamz'sus Cau-
casus, a quihus tola (India) decurrit in planitiem immensam et Aegypto
sl'milssm. Strabo and Arrian more cautiously speak os τὰ πεδία.

Caucaso] this name was given generally to the mountains north os
India by the Greeks, especially to the range os the llindu Kush. Arriau

ἐκάλεον, ἄλλον τοῦτον Καύκασον, οὐ τὸν Σκυθικόν. So before him Strabo
xv 1 ἦ 11, following Eratosthenem in ξ 13 he says of the rivers ἅπαντες

ξ 4. Indus] the name is interesting. Prof M Williams (llinduism
chap 1) says, speaking of the districts near the river Sindhu [now called
the Indus] “the Pers-iaus pronounced this word Hindhfi. and named
their Aryan brethren Ilindt‘is. The Greeks, who probably gained
their first idea os India froin the Persians, dropped the hard aspirate
and called the Hindus Ἰνῦοί.” Compare the words of Pliny N H w
,ξ’ 71 ludas incolis Sindus appellatus. This river was generally recog-
nized as the western boundary of India, though that name was occa-
sionally extended. See lx 10 § 7 and Elphinstone appendix 111 on tlte
(irccle accounts os ludriz. The river aud its affluents are described by
strabo xv 1 ξ 13, Arrian Indica 4 §3 8—13, Pomponius Mela1117,

gelidior] this statement and that concerning the colour of the water

are supported by Burnes [Travels into Bokhara vol 1 pp 74, 77, 79]‚
quoted by Miitzell with the remark that the coldness of the Indus is 111

interesting contrast to the warmth of the Ganges.

ἑῇ. Ganges] the Ganga or Ganges, thought by the ancients to be
the greatest river in the world, is described by Strabo xv 1 ἓ 13, Arrian
Indica 4 ἕξ 2—7, Pomponius Mela 111 7, Pliny N H VI§65. It is
osten referred to by other authors as representing the sar east. Lucan
