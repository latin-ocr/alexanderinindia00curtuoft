Macedonia, and the formation osa national army3 how he took
advantage of the weakness and mutual jealousies of the Greek
states to win sor himself a place among them; how he then by
various arts overcame them one by one and made himself lord
of llellas:—all this is well known to the readers of Grecian
history¹‚ and needs not to be here further dealt with than by
way of allusion. Being now at the height of his power in
Europe, Philip purposed to invade Asia and assail and perhaps
overthrow the Persian monarchy. But he fell in BC 336 by
the sword of an assassin²‚ and Alexander, his son by OlympiaS,
reigned in his stead.

(2) This youth, born to be the ruler of a people just emerg-
ing from barbarism, newly conscious of their strength and
proud os their recent conquestS, had received a training perhaps
more complete in its kind than has fallen to the lot of any other
great king or conqueror. From Leonidas³ he acquired the spare
habits and bodily hardihood which carried him through so
many long and severe campaigns3 from Lysimachus⁴ he learnt
to know and love the Homeric poems, and so his naturally
ambitious spirit was fostered by emulation of the hero Achilles,
whom indeed he claimed as a mythical ancestor of his race.
Under these influences, backed only by his early experience
of warfare, he might indeed have become a great conqueror,
but not Alexander the Creat. It is only fair⁵ in accordance
with the testimony of antiquity to assign the greatest weight in
the matter of his education to the teaching of Aristone& Had
not the prince studied under the first of living philosophers—
one unrivalled in the extent of his learning as in clearness of
thought—he could hardly have attained that intellectual de-
velopment which made conspicuous sor true judgment and wise
forecast a youth who came suddenly to the throne at the age of
twenty and died before he was thirty—three.
