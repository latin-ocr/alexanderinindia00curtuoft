ἐξ 2.- 7] No TES. 89

omnium] genitive aster eximius, which is equivalent to a superia-
tive. Compare Statius Theb VI 15 eximii regum.

ab oriente] on the eastern side os the world, in the east. Compare
the similar usage of a meridie in 10 ἓ 24, and other expressions. This
reading, being adopted by Zumpt Miitzell Foss and Hedicke and having
the Mss authority on its side, has been retained. But the sense thus
given is secble in the extreme. Aldus read ab ortu which he probably
meant to mean ‘srom its source', and he may have had authority sor
the reading. Anyhow Arrian says of the Ganges on the authority of
Megasthenes αὐτόν τε ’γὰρ μέγαν ἀνίσχειν ἐκ τῶν πηγέων, and Pliny alsi
(ιιίἶιίϊιιηί) cum magno fragore Ipsius statim sontis erumpere, statements
such as Curtius loves to make.

rcclo alveo] with straight bedzrunning straight abead. Compare
recta rqu'one above.

stringit] grazes, washes. Compare Virgil Aen VIII 62, 63 where
father Tiber says rgo sum pleno quem flumine cerm's stringentem ripas
etpingyte'a culta sccanlcm. Also Seneca nat quaest ΙΙΙ 27 ἓ 9.

inclinant] see Strabo XV 1 ξ 13, speaking of the Indian rivers,
ἅπαντες δ’ ἀπὸ τοῦ Καυκάσου τὴν ἀρχὴν ἔχουσι καὶ φέρονται μὲν ἐπὶ τὴν
μεσημβρίαν τὸ πρῶτιν, εἶθ’ οἱμὲν μένουσιν ἐπὶ τῆς αὐτῆς φορᾶς καὶ μάλιστα.
οἱ εἰς τὸν Ἰνδὸν συμβάλλοντες, οἱ δ’ ἐπιστρέφονται πρὸς ἕω καθάπερ καὶ
ὁ Γάγγης ποταμός. οὗτος μὲν οὖν καταβὰς ἐκ τῆς ὀρεινῆς ἐπειδὰν ἅψηται
τῶν πεδίων ἐπιστρέψας πρὸς ἕω καὶ ῥυεὶς παρὰ. τὰ Παλίβοθρα μεγίστην
πόλιν πρόεισιν ἐπὶ τήν ταύτῃ θάλατταν, also ἕ 72. Mtttzell points out
that modern researches confirm the statement of Curtius assigning obiectae
rupes as the cause of the river's change of course.

§6. rubro mari] this of course stands sor the Indian ocean gene-
rally. So osten in Curtius and in rhetorical or poetical writers. See
111 2 ξ 9 Indos celeresque rubri maris accolas, IV 12 ἓ 9, vt 2 ς’ 12, IX 6
ἕ 20, x 10 ἓ 4, Virgil Aen VIII 686 (compare 605), Horace carm 1 35
32, pseudo-Tibullus IV z Ic) et quascunque niger rubro de lz'lore conchas
proximus eois collzjgit Indus aquis. If the text be sound here, the
making both rivers (Indus and Ganges) run into the same sea is in
sax-our of the view put forth in a note on ξ 2, that Curtius thought India
longer from east to west than from north to south; he being in sact
ignorant that there was a great tongue of land projecting southwards.
l'tolemy afterwards had the same imperfect conception.

ξ 7. reverberatur] compare IX 9 ἓ 8.

stagnal] forms pools or meres. Arrian VI 14 ξ 5 says that the river
may perhaps be more than 100 stadia broad ἵναπερ λιμνάζει μᾶλλον. 111
his Indica 6 ἓ 5 he speaks of the summer floods in the Indian rivers gene-
rally, so too Strabo XV 1 ἓ 13 βρέχεται τοῖς θερινοῖς ὄμβροις ὴ Ἰνδικὴ καὶ
λιμνάζει τὰ πεδία, also ἓξ 17—20.

insulas] alluvial banks. For these vast silt deposits see IX S ξ 30,
Strabo XV 1 ἓ 16, and sor the Indus in particular Pliny N H VI ξ 71-

molitur] builds up, forms. Compare Virgil Aen III ¹32 ergo avz'ti'us
muros oplalae molior urhis aud other passages.
