μᾶνες (brahmans) living in a grove near their city, who directed most os

called ύλόβιοι are described as ζῶντας ἐν ταῖς ὕλαις ἀπὸ φύλλων καὶ καρ-

description of the visit of Onesikritus to the ascetics. In § 70 we are
told of a rival school to the Brahmans, called ΙΙράμιάι (see index to
Williams’ llc'ndnism under Pramfi, I'ramr’tnas, Pramqva) who seem to
have been a logical and metaphysical school. The following words
seem to refer to the Brahmans: τούτων δὲ τοὺς μὲν ὀρεινοὺς καλεῖσθαι
τοὺς δὲ ’γυμνήτας τοὺς δὲ πολιτικοὺς και προσχωρίοις· τοι “ς μὲν ὀρεινοὺς
δοραῖς ἐλάφων χρῆσθαι, πηρας δ’ ἔχειν ῥιζῶν καὶ φαρμάκων μεστάς, προσ-

tius in the following passage out of a hymn to Agni (ignis, the fite-god
