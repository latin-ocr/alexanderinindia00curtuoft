the submission of king Porus. In this interesting campaign
Alexander got as far as the river Hyphasis¹‚ beyond which his
army refused to advance: so, getting over his disappointment
as best he might, he retraced his steps to the Hydaspes, which
he prepared to descend with a fleet in order to reach the Indus
and whatever sea might lie beyond.

(8) This eventsul voyage, in the course of which Alexander
established his supremacy in the part of India now known as
Sindh, brought him to Patala (at the head of the Indus delta)
early in 325. He now sent some of his army home by an inland
route under Kraterus, and occupied the time while the nautical
preparations were going on at Patala in exploring the branches
of the river and in other excursions with a view to render more
easy the homeward passage of his forces by sea and land. The
hardships endured by the fleet under Nearchus in its voyage²
from the mouth of the Indus to· the Persian Gulf, and the still
greater sufferings of the land force under the king himself in
their march through the deserts of Gedrosiass, are famous in the
records of antiquity‚ and presented beyond doubt a memorable
example of what is possible to unflinching unrelenting determi-
nation. In the hour of their triumph the survivors strove to
forget what they had endured in that terrible journey.

up into the heart of his vast empire, giving earnest attention to
adininistrative reforms and more than ever bent on accomplishing
that fusion of the races beneath his sway to which he had long
looked as the only sure tie by which he could bind together⁴

drus (Satlej>. But it seems probable that in the time of Alexander
these two rivers did not meet at all before joining the Akesines (Che-
nab). See General Cunningham p 222 and map 5.
