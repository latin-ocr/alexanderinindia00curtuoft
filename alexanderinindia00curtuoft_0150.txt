146 Q. CURTI RUFI IIIST. ALEX. [ix4

abt-eliquit] ‘lest behind'. The word generally means to abandon
or sorsake, and its use here is very strange.

circumvectus cst] the geography os this passage is so utterly con·
sused that it is well-niglu useless to attempt any rational explanation.
How he can have sailed round the citadel strictly speaking is very har-«1
to see; and we can only be certain that there is some confusion below
between the two confluences (a) of the Hydaspes and Acesines and
(b) os the Acesines and Indus. Diodorus ‹loes not confuse these but
makes the armament reach the former confluence before these opera-
tions and then sail on to the latter, xvn 97 αὐτὸς δὲ πάλιν μετὰ τῶν
φίλων ἐμβὰς εἰς τὰς ναῦς διὰ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τὸν πλοῦν ἐποιεῖτο μέχρι τῆς
συμβολῆς τών προειρημένων ποταμῶν καὶ τοῦ Ἰνδοῦ.

nnmimcnto] Curtius uses the singular of this word in the same sense
‘ line of fortification’ as the plural. See V111 2 ς 2ofauccs regionis qua
in artzlrsimum cogitur valido nmnimento sepserat, V ι ἓ 3ι.

a septentrione] the meaning of septentriones or septentrio is discussed
by Conington on virgil georg 111 381.

constmditur] ‘ unites with ¹. The notion of blencling is more promi—
nent in 9 ἓ 7.

ξ 9. coetus] the meeting (συμβολὴ) of the rivers.

multoque..sagium] ‘and the navigable way is compressed into a
narrow channel by mud banks kept continually shisting by the soree 01
the meeting waters’.

turbatur] compare 111 4 ἓ 8 Cvdnns non spatio aquarum scd liquore
memorabilis .· qm'ppe leni tractu e fontibus labens puro solo exce'pc'tur, nec
torrentes incurrunt qus· placide manantis alveum turbent.

meant] we are unable to follow Hedicke here in adopting the con-
jecture of Heinsius meatur navtgrz'z's. Compare I‘lin N H 111 ἓ 53
meabilis.

ἓ 10. itaque etc] Arrian VI 4 ἓξ 4—5. ἓ 3 gives a vivid and detailed
account of this violent confluence (according to him that os the Hy-
daspes and Acesines), but says nothing of Alexander's personal danger.
In this however as in other respects the account of Diodorus xv11 97
agrees with that of Curtius. The story os Alexander's upset was
probably preserved in some accounts of the incident and Curtius has of
course eagerly seized upon it as assording a more dramatic situation sor
the display of his rhetorical powers.

lzz'nc‚..l1inc] occurring twice'here close together should perhaps be
taken as ‘partly'...‘partly', ‘both’...‘ancl' in both places. See on
vul 13 ξ 11. But it is true that hinc proras hinc latera may be ren-
‹lered (beating) ‘stom the one side on the prows, srom the other on the

broadsides os the vessels’.

subducere vela] to furl or take in sail. The expression is found also
in the account of the Alexandrine war 45.

metu] the MSS give cetu. Os the various readings proposed we pre·
ser this os Junius accepted by Manen, who well refers to the words 9
ἓ 15 which occur in a passage descriptive of a similar scene os confusion.
