148 Q. CURTI RUFI HJSZ ALEX. [1x4

to thc south of the tribes between the Indus and Hydaspes. Meineke's
text there has Συδρσζκαι.

ΛΙαΙΙονιιηι] this tribe were neighbours of the Sudracae, and their

lchiles townssgems to have occupied the site of the present Multan. See
›e ow on 3.

alias ...... iunxerat] Diodorus xvn 98 says the same, and adds that
tlxileeztsgplrgrgot to loggerheads again and never fought together against

nonaginta etc] Diodorus says ‘ more than 80000 infantry, 10000
cavalry and 700 chariots ⁵.

ἓ 16. integrum] a war, that is, no part of which had been got over.

firmissimis] the most high-spirited nations. Arrian Diodorus and
plielssffiiflgojiyl use the epithet μάχιμος of them, and Strabo calls thern

ἓ ¹7· transmittere] to let go by, hence to ⁴ give up ’. In suver-age
Latin we find many of these pregnant words used with a certain arch·
ness. Compare Tacitus hist lv 9 cam sententiam modestissitmts quisquc
silentio deinde oblivio transmisit: suere qui ct meminissent, also 1 13,
and Juvenal VII 190 exempla novorumfiztorum transi. also 111 114, x
273, VI 60². Render ‘though he had been driven to give up the river
Ganges and the regions beyond, he had not ended the war but only
shisted it ’.

ἓ 18. extra sidera] outside the range of the constellations they had
been used to see in their own zone. Curtius is in this place probably
thinking of Virgil Aen vx 794—796 (os Augustus) super ct Garamantas
stt Indos proferet imperium—iacet extra sidera tellus, extra anni solisque
vias, with which georg 1 231—25 t should be compared.

novis ...... existere] perhaps Curtius has in his head the story of the
serpent’s teeth and Jason; perhaps even the very lines os Ovid heroid
ΧΗ (Medea Jasoni) occurred to him, as sor instance 45—⁴7 sctm'na
praeterea populos genitura iuberis spm'gcre devota lata per arva manu,
qui peterent secum nat is tua cmpora telis, and 95, 96 arva venenatis
fro semine dentibus imples: nascitur ct gladios scutaque miles
habet.

identidem] ‘over and over again ’. The word should be taken
closely with novis. ‘New enemies were ever springing up with arms
ever new’. See 9 ἓξ Ιο, 21.

existere] sor the word compare Lucretius 11 871 quippe videre licet
vivos existere vermes stercore de taetro.
ξ quod...mancre] sor these questions in oratio obliqua see Madvig
, 405 a.

caliginem] there was a very old notion that to go far on the earth
would surely land the voyager at length in a region of eternal darkness.

Racine (Alexandrev 1) imitating the present passage says des diserts quc
lc ciel rcjfuse d’dclairer, σὴ la nature semble elle-mima expirer.

perpetuam] continueris, ‘unbroken’.
