was that of which the great and wealthy city Taxila was the capital.
lt is strange that Curtius should make no mention of this place, which
struck the Greek observers so sorcibly as a city both populous and well-
ordered. See Strabo xv 1 §3' 17, 28, 61, 62, Arrian v 3 ἓ 6, 8 s* 2, V11
2 ἐπ’.. See the interesting remarks os (jeneral Cunningham on this
place. He shews that 50 years after Alexander's visit it was very
weahhy, and that it remained great down to comparatively recent times.
He finds its site near Kalaka Serai.

suerat auctor] ‘had urged '. The preceding quoque merely em-
phasizes patri. See on 10 ἕ 18.

§6. pernuksojuc] this is undoubtedly the right reading. Miitzell
well cites Livy VI 25 permissoque ut cx collegis (filaret quem vrllcl,
XXXVIII 10 pcrmissoque ut et Rhodii ct Athenienses deprecatores ircnl'.
See Madvig ς· 4²9·

ut regnaret] Diodoms does not mention Alexander's answer.

usmpare] compare 111 12 ἓ 16 (of Hephaestion) libertatis quoqne in
admonendo eo non alius ius habebat .· quod tamen ila ztsmpabat ut magis
ιι rege permissum quam wudicatnm ab eo videretur.

sustinuit] did not venture or ‘make up his mind’ to. Compare
lx 1 ξ 34, 10 ἓ 15. In Greek we should probably have οὐκ ἐτόλμησε.

ullius] for this substantival use of ullus by the best writers see
Madvig ἓ 90, 3. Curtius uses the dative (see lx 3 ξ 1), which is less
common.

experiretur] ‘make trial of ’ the good saith (or protection) of any but
Alexander. That is, put himself in the hands os, submit to the autho-
rity of. See §g 9, 1ο. Forfizlcm see lx 1 ξ 23, 7 gg* 13, 14.

ἓ 7. per modica intervalla] at short intervals. See 14 ξ 13.

agminz] this word is continually used by Curtius as the equivalent
of acies. Compare 13 ἕ 19 and chapter 14 passim. This usage is
almost confined to the poets and silver-age prose authors. An excellent
instance is virgil georg 11 280 which Conington's ingenious note cannot
be said to have explained away.

castellorum] so Diodorus XVII 87 in the account of Porus’ forces
before the battle ὴ μὲν οὖν ὅλη σύνταξις αὐτῶν ὑπῆρχε πόλει παραπλήσιος
τὴν πρόσοψιν· ἡ μὲν ’γὰρ τῶν ἐλεφάντων στάσις τοῖς πύρ-γοις, οἱ δὲ ἀνὰ
μέσον τούτων στρατιῶται τοῖς μεσοπυργίοις ὡμοίωντο. See below 14§ 13,
lx 2 ἓ 15.

§¹8. ipre concitat equum] Diodorus says αὐτὸς δὲ μετ’ ὀλίγων προ-
ιῚΓἹΓΕυσας-

ἓ 9. vcl...vel] vel, probably an old imperative os volo, is used in stat-
ing such alternatives as the present where the distinction is not the point
sorcibly insisted on. Here it is especially suitable, since sivansive has
just been used above. We may render vel here ‘ perhaps ’ or ‘it might
be ². See Madvig ἓ 436, and compare above 11} 1 ἓ 18 (of the Gordian
knot) gladioque ruptis omnibus loris oraculi sortem vel elusit vel implevit,
below 1x 5 ἓ 27, Cic in Catil 11 ἓ 1.
